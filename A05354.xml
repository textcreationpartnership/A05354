            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ACRED AND MOST MIGHTIE Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ye moſt puyſſant kynges and Princes Chriſtian, yf you call to mynde and memorye all formes of common wealthes, wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe people in tymes paſt (aſwell heathen as Chriſtians) haue bene preſerued: you ſhall finde none, eyther for peace and tranquyllitie more eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, or for Maieſtie more gloriouſe, than that, where one hathe gouerned, whiche laufullie entred, as right heyr in ſucceſſion: and moderated all thinges with ſincere indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencio, as a Iuſt and vpright Iudge. And, to omitt, that this forme of Gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reſembleth that regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God ruleth the whole world, and how therfore it is the beſt: to omitt alſo that the leagues of forrain Princes, with their mariages, and mutuall agreementes in loue and amitie are herein alſo included, and how therfore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: Likewyſe to lett paſſe the generall peace, quiett, and tranquillitie whiche this aſſureth to all men, and how ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is amiable, the trueth of this matter will more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye appear, if you deeply conſider what iniuries and calamities the people of that country is forced to endure, where an vſurping Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, not by right of ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heir vnto his aunceſtor, but by ambition &amp; ſtronghand violently intrudeth hym ſelfe vpon an other mans right &amp; poſſeſſion. For ſuche a one, (by vexing his ſubiectes with continuall fear, &amp; oppreſſing them with wicked exactions, and more wicked morders) ſticketh not to ſubuert all lawes of God &amp; man, to the ende that he may rule all alone. Thus whiles he moſt cruelly tirannizeth ouer his ſubiects, and they moſt mortally doe hate hym: what miſchiefes and
<pb facs="tcp:8941:3"/>
miſeries do not burſt in vpon any nation by ſuche a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate head and ſuche diſcorde of membres? Vherupon it foloweth well in my Iudgement, that the good will of Princes toward their ſubiectes, and the loue of Subiectes toward their Princes is the ſureſt meanes to keepe and preſerue the publick weal of any Countrie: In ſomuche as, what Region ſo euer wanteth this, muſt eyther be deuided in it ſelfe, and torne in peces with domeſticall troubles: or fall in to the handes of ſtraungers. Therfore of all nations that haue bene in any age, I finde none, that by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of mutuall amitie hathe not bene aduaunced with great felicitye: and none on the other ſyde, that by want therof hathe not, eyther lyke a ſore diſeaſed or wounded bodye languiſhed miſerablye: or vtterly deuolued in to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ruyne and deſtruction. Yea, ſuche miſruled nations haue not alone taſted the calamities of their enormityes: but haue wickedlye alſo caſten out their vonim vpon others: and with ſuche contagious poyſon, haue infected their neighboures rownd about them. So as all Princes Chriſtian, that deſire long to Raigne, haue hereby to note and learne, how it behoueth them, not onlie to rule their own Countries without all manner of Tirannie: but allſo to prouyde (ſo muche as in them lyeth) that their neighbours be not oppreſſed by Tyrannes. For ſuche neyghborhoode can not be but contagiouſe: becauſe it is the nature of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannes, firſt to ranſake and ſpoyle their own people, and afterward to breake owt vpon others, and to ruyne them, all manner of wayes. And this I wryte, to the ende, that all Chriſtian Princes, aſwell for their own ſake, as for Charitie alſo toward their Chriſtian neighbours, ſhould haue ſome ſpeciall care to helpe, that my Soueraigne Ladye Marye, Queene of Scotland, and the moſt noble King her ſonne be not excluded, and barred frome their right of inheritance and ſucceſſion to the Croune of England, after the laufull yſſues of King Henrye the eyght be all deceaſſed: Leaſt that, by vniuſt intruſion and inuaſion of vnlaufull vſurpers, the true heyr be defeated, that floriſhing Kyngedome by tyrannie ruyned, and the neighbours adioyning conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſlye annoyed. Fort ſithe it is euidently knowen, that all thoſe commodities and riches wherwith England hathe plentifully furniſhed, not onlye it ſelfe, but other countries alſo, haue growen ſpecially by this occaſion, that it hathe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8941:3"/>
bene hitherto ſweetlye and peaceablye gouerned by the true and laufull heyrs, to the great honour of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and commoditie of the Subiectes: and ſeing it is alſo manifeſt, that after the deceaſes of all the yſſues laufullie deſcended from Kyng Henrie the eight (as I ſayd before) the Kyngdome of England by right euery waye belongeth vnto Marye the Queene of Scotland: who ſeeth not, that if the ſame Ladye be excluded from her right: then not only that Realm ſhall be ſpoyled of their own commodities, and their neighboures want thoſe helpes which they haue long enioyed: but alſo, that Region wilbe a neaſt of Tyrannes, where euery familie ſhall robbe it ſelfe, and as mere ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſpoile and morder one an other?</p>
            <p>Now then, becauſe ſome vniuſt Competitors incenſed with deſire of rule, doe couer their ambition by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a title to the Croune of England: I thought it to be a part of my duetie, to infringe their vntrue ſurmiſes: and by ſtrong and weightie argumentes to proue, and ratifie the laufull title and right of the Queene and Kynge my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes. For ſo, I hope it will fall owt, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kinges and Potentates will more reddelye performe ſuche honorable offices of Courteſie and Charitie, as all Princes owe one to an other: and that ſpeciallie, when they ſhall ſee the veritie, integritie, and iuſtice of this cauſe ſo expreſſelie declared, as no ſcruple therof can ſtick in the hart of any indifferent perſone. For thoughe generallie all Chriſtian Kynges are (as it wer) ſo lynked to gether, as they ſhould aide and defende eache others honour and dignitie in reſpect that they are Kynges: Yet euery one of them in ſome one or other particulrr reſpecte is ſo allied vnto the Queene and Kyng of Scotland, as they owght to take her part, and to ioyne with her againſt her enemies. And (to ſurceaſe from ſpeaking any more of the common bond of loue among all Princes generallye) I may not herein ouer paſſe that godlye father which ſittethe in the holy Seat, and (as it is well knowen) like a ſecond Samuel will not anoint with holye oyle, (that is to ſay, confirme by his authoritie) any other to be rulers ouer Chriſtians, than ſuche Princes as might well ſeme to be Sauls and Dauids, whiche repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the perſones of all laufull Kynges. For beſide her vndoubted right of Succeſſion (which is accounted a kynd of diuine callyng and choyſe to a Kyngdome) this may ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
<pb facs="tcp:8941:4"/>
perſuade hym to defend her as his daughter, whiche neyther by ſtraitneſſe of priſon, nor by any kinde of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could be hitherto ſeduced from honoring him as her father. VVhat nede is there to call vpon the moſt ſacred Emperour, and other Kynges and Princes in particular, ſith they are all allied vnto the ſayd noble Queene, eyther by a ſure knot of amitie, and frendſhip, or by a moſt faſt bond of conſanguinitie and kynred? Neyther is it neceſſarie to proue this by genealogies and pedegrues, ſeing the world allredye knoweth that ſhe is deſcended, both by father and mother, from the moſt noble Princes, Kynges, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the whole Chriſtian worlde.</p>
            <p>As for the nobilitie and Commons of England, this ſhould moue them to loue her, that ſhe is come ſo many wayes of Engliſh blood, and had her great Grandmother out of the Princelie houſe of Somerſet, and had for her Grandmother the Lady Margaret, eldeſt daughter to King Henrye the ſeuenth. And is not this muche to moue them further, that ſhe was by this meanes ſo muche affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Engliſhe Nation, as in her troubles &amp; afflictions at home, ſhe rather hoped for relefe at their handes, and therfore truſted the now Queene of England, vpon her, promiſes, ſo farre, as ſhe made her choyſe, rather to come for ſuccoure to the Engliſhe (where now ſhe liueth in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) than to other Princes her ſpeciall freends: of whome ſhe was aſſured to haue found relefe and ſuccour? Adde this withall, that before all other Chriſtian Princes, ſhe choaſe an Engliſhe man to be her huſband, and by hym brought foorthe a ſonne, heyr to the ſame Kyngdome. VVhat ſhould I report of the ſignes and tokens of her pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wiche now ſhe ſhoweth in England, or of her Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, good will and loue towarde the Engliſh Nation: how freendlye ſhe thinketh of them, how honorably ſhe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of them, and how nobly ſhe writeth of them, yea how that by long conuerſing with them, ſhe hath now ſo perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlie lerned their manners, their language, and their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as hauing almoſt forgot all other faſhions, ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be brought in to this world, by the prouidence of God, iuſtlie to gouerne the people of England?

For ſuche is the force thereof in matters of greate importance, as the perſone in whome it is once well eſtablyſhed can not be at any time, eyther by counſeil ſeduced, by iniquitie of time imbaſed, by fortunes frowning diſquyeted, nor by any violence ſhaken, muche leſſe ouerthrowen or deſtroyed: In ſomuche as, I muſt nedes ſaye that, whoſoeuer wanteh this guyft of nature: he is not onlye farre from all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of conſtancie and wyſedome in greate affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: but alſo putteth of all humanitie, and is become impious, wylde, and ſauage. And this ſenſe or feling of loue and amitie, although it be naturally planted in euery man and woman: yet is it moſt eſpeciallye in them, that are by blood and kynred moſt neerly conioyned together. VVherfore, ſo often as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the tender loue of parents toward their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; the pietie of children toward their parents: I

And ſo often alſo (moſt graciouſe Princes) I fynde iuſt cauſe to moue me in the behalfes of your Maieſties, and of your ſubiectes, to reioyſe, and to gyue God thankes, for that theſe lawes of nature and guyftes of grace in you by God ſingularlye planted, you haue reſerued and kept whole and inuiolate, from the iniurie of the time, and from the malytiouſe ſtinges of peruerſe detractours: in ſuche ſorte as, you could not, by any other occaſion, haue gyuen a better teſtimonie of honorable courteſie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: nor haue raiſed in the hartes of your ſubiectes a more aſſured hope of the beſt mean to preſerue, yea and to enlarge alſo, and amplyfie your kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

Erneſtlie therfore, and in the moſt deutifull manner that I can deuiſe, I humblie beſeche your Maieſties, at no time to ſuffer the accuſtomed heat of your mutuall loue, in any one point, to coole: but that it take ſuch deep holde, and daily encreaſe ſo muche within your graciouſe breſtes, as it neuer be extinguiſhed, eyther by treaſon of falſe detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, by the cruell fickleneſſe of fortune, or by any flagitiouſe meanes that the malice of this world may procure.

            <p>Now, as touching the exceding tender loue and zeale of mothers towardes their children: it is of ſuche force, as hath wrought very much profitt, not only to priuate families, but alſo to whole common wealthes, yea and to the greateſt Empyres. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aroſe the honorable fame of Eurydice of Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, for that being a baniſhed woman in Illyria, &amp; well ſtroken in aige, ſhe applyed her mynde wholy to learnyng: to the ende ſhe might better inſtruct her owne children. But, (to come ſomewhat nearer to your Maieſtie, my deare Soueraigne ladye) if the care of this woman ouer her children, and of all other mothers whoſouer, be compared whith your woonted ſingular loue towardes your ſonne: ſo muche further ſhall you exceede them all, as it hath bene harder in this yron age, conſtantlye to holde that courſe of vertueouſe loue, which your Grace, with continuall care, and great fortitude, hath kept and performed towardes his Maieſtie. But how ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull you haue bene for his ſafetie (beinge your only ſonne, well beſeemyng ſuch a mother as your ſelfe, and right woorthie to be your beſt beloued) your motherly affection hath bene declared many wayes in your owne perſone: As your great inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; earneſt trauaill in commendinge hym to the tuition of ſuch as were thought moſt faithfull, hath giuen good proofe thereof.

thereof (by violent expulſion of a laufull authoritye, and by iniuriouſe intruſion of others) tranſeformed and deformed: then (alas) what fear and dreed poſſeſſed your tendre hart, what anguiſhe and vexation your carefull mynde endured for his ſake, that is to you moſt deare: all the worlde may eaſely iudge: and they beſt of all, that knowe what it is to be a mother of an infant, beinge vnder the warde of his mortall enemyes. But with what faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce your Grace dealt for his ſafetie, aſwell with the nobilitie, as with thoſe whiche had the cuſtodye of hym, (not by letters onlye but by meſſengers alſo: and by great rewardes aſwell as by other gentle intreatye) I my ſelfe, am a preſent witneſſe, and (as I think) no man eyther can better teſtifie, or ought more plainly to manifeſt the ſame.

And this trauaille longe agoe whiles I was Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour in England I dyd willynglye take in hand: aſwell, thereby to wynne the good willes of many vnto you, as for the honour and generall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of your Countrie: VVherein at that time I had muche conference with ſome of the moſt expert and ſkillfulleſt Iudges &amp; beſt practized counſeilers towardes the lawes of that land: and after many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes and muche debatinge, I clearly ſifted owt their opinions, and Iudgementes, touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And not longe after vpon mature deliberation: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had well reuolued theſe thinges in my mind: I thought it euery waye agreable to my deutie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde

your Maieſties &amp; your Countrie, to contriue in ſome litle volume what I had learned in ſo longe tyme: being alſo hereunto induced by the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diuerſe Chriſtian Princes: whome, after my departure out of England, coming to viſit them, I had made acquainted with this matter: whiche they were glad to hear, and for their better inſtruction deſirous to be infourmed therof at more length by writing. VVherevpon, firſt to ſatiſfie the honorable meanynge of thoſe noble perſonages, I compiled and publiſhed a Treatiſe of this matter in latin. And now further to accompliſhe my deutie in defence of your Royall Dignities, and to ſetle the myndes of the wauering communaltie, and for the generall commoditie of all ſuche as haue any intereſt in this matter, I haue ſett forthe this Treatiſe in Engliſh. And I verilye hope (ſuche is your princelie good meanyng, my moſt vndoubted Soueraignes) that you will accept in good parte this my trauaile, as a teſtimonie of my duetifull good will, reuerence, &amp; ſeruice to your Maieſties: and that you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue my intention and aduiſe to this attempte, as (in your iudgement) agreable to the weight of ſo great a cauſe: and allowe thereof, for the manyfold commodities that therehence may ariſe.</p>
            <p>Now then, as a right and laufull combination of manye Regions by iuſt title of ſucceſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longyng to you, moſt manifeſtlie argueth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth a Regall Soueraigntie, deriued vnto you by many famouſe kynges, your Maieſties Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: ſo doeth the ſame require and exact of you an vnion and coniunction of mindes, and a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the vertue and religion of your forefathers. For nothinge can be more agreable with the name and title of a king, and with the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume of ſo noble a ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as ſo fortunatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth

from ſuche a mother to ſuche a ſonne, than that with ſuche an vndoubted title &amp; right to rule a kyngdome, there be annexed an vniforme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in ſincere Religion. To whiche ende, as the mother hitherto moſt religiouſlie foloweinge the vertue, faith, and pietie of her noble progenitoures hathe euermore ſhowed ſuche conſtancie, as that Sexe ſcarſely beareth: ſo the yong kyng her ſonne in ſucceſſion goeng with her, muſt diligently fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſee, that in a ſincere profeſſion of one ſelfe ſame Catholik religion, he be not behynd her: but that, as he hath truely imitated all her other vertues, wherein ſhe woonderfully excelleth her own ſelfe: ſo he reſemble her in true faith and in vniformitie of the Catholique Religion. And thus the mother can haue no occaſion offered her to remitt any part of her true loue, and affection towardes her ſonne: but by daily encreaſe of naturall affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s betwene them, ſhe will ſo anſwer hym in courteouſe kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: as, thoughe ſhe be foreſtalled of his preſence, yet ſhall ſhe enioye great comfort of hym in his abſence: in ſo muche as, all the world at home and abrode ſhall admire and wonder at their laudable emulation in offices of naturall zeale and pietie: Yea, thus it will fall out, that your own people (moued by your example) will induce one an other to peace and amitie: and freely of their own accorde, without any contention, will offer vppe vnto you, ſuche kyngdomes, regions, &amp; prouinces, as are, or ſhalbe due vnto you by right: and deſire nothinge more than to be vnder the dominion of them, whome they ſee in one mynde, faythe, and religion, with good lawes and true Iuſtice mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their common wealthe. VVhiche kyngdomes and the Subiectes thereof, God the kynge of all kynges which ruleth the hartes of all Princes graunt

            <p>And nowe, if almightie God ſhould (as we be all, bothe prince and others, ſubiecte to mortall chaunces) once bereaue the Realme of England of their preſent Queene: the hartes and mindes of men being no better, nor more firmely ſetled and ſtayed towardes the expectation of a certain ſucceſſion, than they ſeme now to be: then woe &amp; alas, it woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth my very hart, euen once to thinke vpon the imminent, and almoſt ineuitable perilles of that noble Realme, being lyke to be ouerwhelmed with the raiging, &amp; roaring waues, &amp; ſtormes of mutuall diſcorde, and to be conſumed with the terrible fire of ciuil diſſention.</p>
            <p>The feare whereof is the more, by reaſon that already in theſe later yeres, ſome flames of this horrible fire haue ſparkled and fluſhed abroad: &amp; ſome part of the rage of thoſe fluddes haue beaten vpon the Engliſhe ſhores: I mean the hote conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hath there bene ſturred in ſo many places, and among ſo many perſones: Of bookes alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed abroode, ſo many wayes faſhioned &amp; fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as either depraued affection peruerſely luſted, or zelous defenſe of truthe ſincerely moued men.</p>
            <p>Seing therfore, that there is iuſt cauſe of fear, and of great daunger lykely to happen, by this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of mennes myndes and opinions, ſo diuerſely affected, aſwell of the meaner ſort of menne, as of greate perſonages: I take it to be the parte of euery naturall Engliſhe man, &amp; of ſuche as fauoure them, to labour and trauaile (eache man for his poſſibilitie, and for ſuche talent as God hath gyuen hym) that this ſo imminent a miſchiefe may be in conuenient time preuented.</p>
            <p>VVe ſee what, witt, policye, paynes, and charges
<pb facs="tcp:8941:12"/>
men employe, with dammes, weares, and all kynde of ingenious deuiſes, to prouide, that the ſea or other riuers doe not ouerflowe or burſt the bankes, in ſuche places, as are moſt ſubiecte to ſuche daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. VVe knowe alſo, what politike prouiſion is made, in many good Cities and townes, that no daungerous fires do aryſe through negligence: and that the furie therof (if any happen) may ſpeedilye be repreſſed with diligence. VVherein Auguſtus the Emperour, among other his famours actes, is woorthely commended &amp; honored, for appointing in Rome an ordinary wache of ſeuen companies in ſeuerall places, to preuent ſuche miſchiefes, as come by fyre: being hereunto induced, by reaſon that the Citie was ſet on fire in ſeuen ſeuerall places in one daye. And ſhall not then euery man, for his part and vocation, haue a vigilant care and reſpect to extinguiſhe and quenche fuche a fyre alreadye burſten owt, as may (if the matter be not wyſelye looked vnto) ſubuert, diſtroy and conſume, not one Citie onlye, but alſo a whole Realme &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye?</p>
            <p>VVhiche to ſuppreſſe, one ready and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſe waye (as I thinke) is, that the Countrey men &amp; people of that nation may throughly vnderſtand and knowe, from time to time, in what perſone the right of ſucceſſion of the Croune of that Realme doeth ſtande and remayne. For now, many men, partly through ignorance of the ſayd right &amp; title, &amp; partly through ſiniſter perſuaſion of ſome lewd pamphlets (whereunto they haue too lightly giuen credit) are ſeduced and caried away quite from the right opinion and good meaning, whiche once they had conceiued, and from the reuerence and duetie, that they other wyſe woulde, and ſhoulde haue.</p>
            <p>VVhiche corruption of Iudgement and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8941:12"/>
I doe hartely wiſhe to be plucked out of the hartes and mindes of men: and ſhall in this Treatiſe, doe my beſt indeuoure, with moſte ſtrong reaſons and prooſes, to remoue the ſame: not preſuminge vpon my ſelfe, that I am better able than all others this to doe: but vpon duety and zeal to open a waye fot the knoulege of trueth, whiche by ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct meanes is reſtreined, obſcured, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tde: after reading and vewing of ſuche bookes, and the argumentes therof, as haue bene ſet forth by the aduerſaires to the contrarie, (whiles I was in England, Ambaſſador for my moſt gratiouſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne ladye, the Quene of Scotland) I attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted this woork, not vnrequeſted of ſome noble perſonages, then of great accompte: nor without the aduiſe, counſail, and Iudgement of ſome, verie ſkillfull in the cuſtomes, lawes, and ſtatutes of that Realme.

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ERTAINE IT IS,<note place="margin">Queene of Scots right heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Croune of England.</note> and aſſuredlie tried and knowen to all men, that (after the deceaſe of Elizabeth, now Queene of England, without laufull yſſue of her bodie) the Soueraigne Gouernement of that Realme (by right and iuſt title of a laufull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion) is to remayn and come to Marie, the moſt noble Queene of Scotland, and from her to the ſayd Kyng Iames.

For,<note place="margin">A vvoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England.</note> (to let paſſe as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by others aunſwered and clearly confuted, that abſurde paradox, &amp; heretical aſſertion blowen abrode, by vndiſcrete and ſeditiouſe libells, againſt the regiment of women) I make this full accoumpt and reckening, as of a thing moſt clearly knowne, and confeſſed in the hartes and myndes of euery true Engliſh man, and as agreable with the lawes of God and nature: that for default of heyr male, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable to the Croune of England, the next heir

            <p>In like manner it is euident and playne, that the right noblye renoumed Princeſſe, of famouſe memorye, Lady Margaret, ſome tyme Queene of Scotland, &amp; eldeſt daughter of the ſeuenth Henry, King of England, and of his moſt noble wyfe, Queene Elizabeth, the vndouted heir of the howſe of Yorke, was maried to Iames, King of Scotland, the fowerth of that name: by whome ſhe had one only ſonne called king Iames the fift: &amp; that the ſaid moſt excellent Princeſſe, Marye, now Queene of Scotland, is the ſole daughter of the ſame King Iames the fift. VVherupon it falleth owt, that after the deceſſes of the heirs males of the bodies of the ſayed kyng Henry the ſeuenth and Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth his ſayd wyfe, whithout laufull iſſue of their bodies, then the right, title, and intereſt to the Croune of England ought to deſcend,<note place="margin">Margaret King He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the ſeuenth his eldeſt daughter, graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to the Scottiſh Queene.</note> and come, by a laufull courſe of inheritaunce and ſucceſſion, firſt &amp; before all others, to the ſayd moſt gracious Lady, Marie Queene of Scotland, as next heir, in a laufull deſcent, from her ſayd graundmother, the ſayd Queene Margaret, eldeſt daughter of the ſayd King Henry the ſeuenth, and of Queene Elizabeth his ſayd wyfe.</p>
            <p>Now, this is a briefe narration of ſuche an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truthe, as ſhould nede no further explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if men were deuoutlye inclined to credit a truthe. But becauſe ſome men are by ambition ſo blynded, &amp; caried away with their own phantaſies,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8941:15"/>
as they mynd nothing more, than with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentiouſe quarrelles, to obſcure and deface this matter: I muſt fet a further courſe: and though the thing be playn enough of it ſelfe: yet muſt it be delated with a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſcourſe of many proofes, experimentes and examples: to the intent that all thoſe Competitors and Chalengers, whiche oppoſe them ſelues againſt her Maieſties right (albeit of them ſelues they will not yeeld to reaſon) may neuertheleſſe be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced, and daunted, as they ſhall haue nothing left to gaynſaye, when the truthe of the cauſe ſhalbe clearlye reuealed, and ſincerely layd open, to the vewe of Princes, and people of all nations.</p>

            <p>Edward Prince of wales dyed before his father &amp; left a ſonne which ſucceded his Graund father, &amp; was called king Richard the ſecond.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8941:17"/>Yet neuertheleſſe, the houſe of Lancaſtre did ſtand. For Iohn of Gaunt before named, by his third and laſt wyfe, had a ſonne, called Iohn Erle of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet, and Marques of Dorceſtre. And this Iohn had a ſonne, named Iohn Duke of Somerſet, and Erle of Montague: and a daughter called Ioan: ſhe was maried to the firſt Iames king of Scotland, the third of the houſe of Stewards, after the two Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts, the ſecond and third.

            <p>The ſayd Iohn Duke of Somerſet and Erle of Montague had one onely Daughter called Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Ducheſſe of Somerſet: whiche was maried to Edmond, afterward Erle of Richemond brother, of the halfe blood, to king Henry the ſixt, by one &amp; the ſame mother, the ſayd Queene Catharin: for his fathers name was Owen Teuther, the ſecond huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the ſame Queene Catharin.

            <p>But (to come to the houſe of york, deſcended of the fowerth ſonne of kyng Edward the third) ſo it is that Richard the before named Erle of Cambridge, by his ſayd wyfe the Lady Anne mortimer before named the only heir of the houſe of Clarence, had (as is before ſayd) a ſonne called Richard Duke of York.

This Edward Duke of York (as is before mentioned) put the ſixt king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry in priſon, obteined the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſo brought the Croune to the houſe of York, and was called king Edward the fowerth. He had a ſonne whiche ſucceded hym, and was called kyng Edward the fyft: and a Daughter, the Lady Elizabeth, afterward wyfe to king Henry the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth. The ſecond brother George Duke of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was by his brother kyng Edward the fowerth put to death: he had a daughter, the Lady Margaret, Counteſſe of Sariſburie, afterward maried to Pole. The third brother, Richard duke of Gloceſtre, after the deceaſſe of his brother King Edward the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth, cauſed the yong kyng, Edward the fyft, his ſaid brothers ſonne, traiterouſly to be mordered: &amp; lyke a Tyranne vſurped the Croune, and called him ſelfe king Richard the third: but (as he iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued) he dyed diſhonorably, and was ſlain in the battail beſide Boſſeworth, by king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, &amp; ſo dyed without iſſue. This ſeuenth king Henry, deſcended of the houſe of Lancaſtre, was then the principal perſone of the other partie agaynſt the houſe of York. But (to take away the matter of that contention) he maried the ſaid Elizabeth daughter to the ſayd King Edward the fouerth,<note place="margin">The vnion of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of York and Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre.</note> then right heir of the houſe of York: and ſo by vniting thoſe two houſes, he dyd cut of all thoſe long and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe broyles: Thus I haue brieflye: ſet downe the original cauſe, and the finall ende alſo, of that ſo great and troubleſſome faction.</p>

Henry the ſeuenth: he had by his ſaid wyfe, Quene Elizabeth, a ſonne called king Henry the eight (for his other ſonnes I omit, becauſe they died in the life tyme of their father, and without iſſue.) And he had alſo two daughters, Margaret, wyfe of the fowerth kyng Iames of Scotland, and Marie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wyfe of the twelueth king Lewes of Fraunce. This king Henry the eight had for his firſt wyfe, Catharin daughter to Ferdinando king of Spayn: and by her he had a daughter, the Ladye Marye, afterward Queene of England. But vnder a pretence that the ſayd Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin was the wyfe of his deceaſſed brother Arthur, he putt her awaye, and brought in Anne Bolleine, daughter of Syr Thomas Bolleine knight: and by her he had a daughter the moſt renowmed Lady, Elizabeth, now Queene of England: And afterward he ſtroke of the head of the ſayd Anne, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the Ladye Iane Semer, a knyghtes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: by whom he had his ſonne Edward: whiche afterward was Kinge Edward the ſixt, and dyed without yſſue. Then were called to the crown by ſucceſſion, firſt the ſayd Lady Marie: and after her, the ſayd Ladye Elizabeth now Queene. After whoſe deceaſſes, without any laufull yſſue of their bodyes, the next place in ſucceſſion ought of right to remayn to the ſayd moſt noble Ladye Marye, now Queene of Scotland,</p>

            <p>King Henry therfore the ſeuenth, by the ſayd Queene Elizabeth daughter to king Edward the fowerth had (as you haue heard) his ſaid ſonne king Henry the eight, and his ſayd two daughters, the

Of the ſayd Queene Margaret, eldeſt daughter to the ſeuenth king Henry of England, was by the ſayd King Iames the fowerth, her firſt buſband, begotten and borne, the fift king Iames of Scotland, father to the ſayd moſt noble Ladye, Marie, now Queene of Scotland. And after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the ſayd king Iames the fowerth, the ſame Queene Margaret was maried to Archebald Erle of Anguiſh, and by him had a daughter, called the Ladie Margaret Duglaſſe, ſometyme the wyfe of Mathew Steward, Erle of Leneux, by whom ſhe had two ſonnes, Henry and Charles, of whom I will ſpeake here after.</p>
            <p>Mary the yonger daughter of king Henry the ſeuenth after the deceaſe of her firſt huſband the twelueth, king Lewes of Fraunce,<note place="margin">The yſſue of Marye the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che Queene.</note> by whom ſhe had no yſſue, was maried to Charles Brandon, Duke of Sulffolk: by whom ſhe had two daughters: Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſe &amp; Eleonor. For of her ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes I omitt to ſpeak, becauſe they died without iſſue. The ſaid Lady Franciſe was maried to Henry Gray Marqueſſe of Dorceſtre, afterward Duke of Suffolke. This Henry Gray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat of her, thre daughters, to witt, Iane, Catharin, &amp; Mary. The ſame Lady Iane eldeſt of thoſe thre, was maried to Gilford Dudley, the ſonne of Iohn duke of Northumberland: a mariage begunne in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate houre: for it brought with it deſtruction aſwell to them bothe, as to their parents, and many others. The ſayd Ladye Catharin was eſpouſed to Henry Harbert eldeſt ſonne of VVilliam Erle of
<pb facs="tcp:8941:19"/>
Pembroche. And the Ladye Marye yongeſt of the ſaid three, was betrothed to Arthur Gray, ſonne of VVilliam Gray: But bothe thoſe contractes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the procurement and ſpecial labour of the parentes, rather than vpon good matter (as I haue heard) were in open court diſſolued, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be of no validitie in law. The like happened touching a priuie contract made betwene the ſame Lady Chatharin &amp; the Erle of Hartforde, by whom ſhe had two ſonnes yet lyuing. Of whome I will ſpeak hereafter. And thus farre touching the iſſue of the Lady Franciſe, thone of the ſayd two daughters of Charles Brandon by Mary the Frenche Queene.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the ſayd Lady Eleonor, the other daughter of the ſayd Mary. This Eleonor was maried to George Clyfford, Erle of Cumberland: who had by her a daughter, the Lady Margaret, now wyfe to the Erle of Darby: whiche two haue iſſue betwene them yet liuing. And this is the true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie and pedegrue (forſomuch as I could euer learn) of all ſuche iſſue and ofſpring deſcended of king Henry the ſeuenth, and Queene Elizabeth his wyfe, as at this day can claime any right title, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Croune of England. The remayn is to adde hereunto ſomewhat touching the progenie of the before named king Edward the fowerth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The yſſue of King Edvvard the fouerth</note>This king Edward the fowerth, the principall perſonne of the faction of the whyte Roſe, had two ſonnes: whom his brother Richard, aſpiring to the Croune (a patern of the worſt marke that euer was in the memory of man) cauſed to be mordred: And he had alſo fower daughters: the eldeſt was Queene Elizabeth the before named wyfe of King Henry the ſeuenth, the cheefe of the faction of the reade Roſe, as is before mentioned. An other of the daughters was the Lady Catharin, wyfe to VVillia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Courtney, Erle of Deuonſhire. Of the other two daughters, there is left no iſſue, and therfore I omitt them. This Lady Catharin had by the ſayd Erle of deuonſhire, a ſonne called Henrie Courtney, whom his Coſin germain, king Henry the eight cauſed to be beheaded vpon a pretenſe of treaſon. This Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courtney left one onlye ſonne called Edward Courtney, whom in his tender yeres king Henry the eight impriſoned in the Tower of london, (where he remayned many yeres) till the death of king Edward the ſixt: At whiche time that patterne of ſingular clemencie Queene Marie dyd not only delyuer hym, but alſo reſtored hym to his auncient eſtate of blood and dignitie. This yong noble man afterward dyed without iſſue at Padua in Italie: but if he had liued: he might with beſt right haue clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Croune of England, after the iſſues of king Henry the ſeuenth, and Queene Elizabeth his wyfe had bene extinguiſhhed.</p>
            <p>In this Courtney now deceaſed, the progenie of King Edward the fowerth had bene determined, as concerning the ſtreight line, if the ofſpring of king Henry the ſeuenth, and Quene. Elizabeth his wyfe, were not yet liuing. But if that (at any tyme) faile: then muſt they ſeke for an heyr in the collateral line.</p>
            <p>Therfore it is to be noted,<note place="margin">The colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall lyne of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion.</note> that the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Richard Plantagenet Duke of York (which was ſlayn by Henry the ſixt in the battail of wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild, and of whoſe progenie we now ſpeake,) had three ſonnes: to witt, king Edward the fowerth: George Duke of Clarence, and Richard Duke of Gloceſtre. Now then, for default of iſſue in lineal deſcent from Edward the eldeſt brother, we muſt haue recourſe (as is before ſayd) vnto the collateral deſcent, that is, to George Duke of Clarenee, the
<pb facs="tcp:8941:20"/>
ſecond brother, and to his ſucceſsion. For to ſpeak any more of Richard the yongeſt brother, whiche dyed without iſſue, it were ſuperfluouſe.</p>
            <p>George then, duke of Clare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (,yonger brother to Edward the fowerth) had by his vyfe, Iſabell (Counteſſe of VVarwik and Sariſbury) two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to witt, Edward and Margaret. This George vpon ſuſpition of treaſon to affect the kyngdome, was by kyng Edward his brother priuilye put to deathe: And his ſonne Edward being but a child empriſoned in the Tower of lond, where he was deteined vntill at laſt, vpon lyke ſurmiſe, kinge Henry the ſeuenth ſtroke of his head But the ſayd Lady Margaret, Counteſſe of Sariſburie, was maried to Sir Richard pole knight, by whom ſhe had diuers ſonnes: to wytt, Henry, Arthur, Geffray, &amp; Reinald, the ſame, which afterward for his rare vertues and ſingular wiſdome and learning, was aduaunced to the dignitie of a Cardinal,<note place="margin">Cardinal Pole.</note> and called Cardinal Pole. Henry the eldeſt brother (to omitt the reſt) had two daughters: Catharin Pole the elder ſiſter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was maried to Franciſe Haſtinges, Erle of Huntingdon: and VVenefride the yonger ſiſter. Of whiche VVenefride there is no nede to ſpeak any more: becauſe there is yet liuing, deſcended of the ſayd Ladye Catharin, a plentifull generation. Thus it is euident and very playn that whan the lineal deſcent in bloode from king Henry the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth and Queene Elizabeth, his wyfe ſhall fayle: then muſt the right of the white Roſe, that is to ſaye, of the houſe of Yorke, whiche dyd ſpring of king Edward the fowerth be tranſplanted, and be deriued by a collateral lyne from George Duke of Clarence vnto the houſe of the Poles, and ſo vnto the houſe of haftings or Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingdon.</p>

And that is Philip the king Catholique of Spayn deſcended from Iohn of Gaunt Duke of Lancaſtre, third ſonne of king Edward the third. For the ſayd Iohn of Gaunt had two daughters: Philipp and Catharin. This Ladye Philipp was mother to Edward king of Portugal: of whome all other the kings of Portugal, ſithince that tyme till this day, are deſcended. This Edward king of Portugal was father to Eleonor the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe, whiche was mother to Maximilian, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: father to Philipp king of Caſtil, father to that moſt victoriouſe Emperour Charles the fift, father to the moſt prudent Prince, Philipp, the King Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik of Spayn, now raigning, &amp; to the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe Ladye Marie, mother to Rudolphus now Emperour.</p>
            <p>But (no to omitt any thing which appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Royall ſucceſsion) I think it good to adde a word or two touching the Lady Margaret Duglaſſe, Aunt (that is to ſaye, ſiſter to the father) of my Soueraign Lady, now Queene of Scotland: her mean whiche was maried to the Erle of Leneux: a mariage verie plauſible to king Henrye the eight, or he indued her with great poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in England: this Ladye Margaret had by the ſayd Erle two ſonnes, Henry and Charles.

            <head>A FVRTHER PROOFE OF THE SAYD TITLE OF SVC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSION, VVITH A RESOLVTION OF the obiections of the Aduerſaries.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VE SAY THEN and affirme, that the next right Heire &amp; Succeſſour appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vnto the Croune of the Realme of England, is at this time ſuche a one, as for the excellent guiftes of God and nature in her moſt princely appearing, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to inherit either that noble Realme, or any other, be it of much more dignitie and worthines.</p>
            <p>But nowe I clame nothing, for the worthines of the perſone, whiche God forbid ſhould be any thing preiudiciall to the iuſt title of others. Yf moſt open and manifeſte right, iuſtice and title do not concurre with the woorthines of the perſone: then let the praiſe and woorthines remaine where it is, and the right where God and the lawe hath placed it.</p>
            <p>But ſeing God, Nature and the lawe doth call the perſon to this expectation, whoſe intereſt and clame I do now proſequute (I meane my vndouted ſoueraine Ladye, Marye Queene of Scotlande) I hope, that when her right and iuſte title ſhalbe throughly heard and conſidered by the indifferent Reader, if he be perſuaded already for her right, he ſhalbe more firmelye ſetled in his true and good opinion: and that the other parties, being of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie minde, ſhall finde good cauſes and groundes, to remoue them from the ſame, and to geue ouer and yelde to the truthe.</p>
            <p>Her Graces Title then, as it is moſt open and
<pb facs="tcp:8941:24"/>
euidente, ſo it is moſte conformable to the lawe of God, of Nature, and of that Realme: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlye, in a manner, of all other Realmes in the worlde, as growing by the neareſt proximitie of the Royal blood. She is a Kinges and a Queenes daughter, her ſelfe a Queene, daughter (as is before declared) to the late King Iames of Scotlande ſonne to Ladie Margarete the eldeſt Syſter to the late King Henrie the eight. VVhoſe daughter alſo the late Ladie Lenoux was, by a later huſbande. But Ladie Frauncis, late wife to Henrie Marques Dorſette, afterwarde Duke of Suffolke: and the Ladie Eleonour, late wife to the Earle of Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, and their Progenie proceede from the Lady Marie, Dowager of Fraunce, yongeſt Siſter of the ſayd King Henrye, late wyfe to Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolke as is before declared.</p>
            <p>I might here fetche foorth olde farne dayes. I might reache backe to the noble &amp; worthie Kings long before the Conqueſt, of whoſe Royal blood ſhe is deſcended. VVhiche I Intend not to treat vpon at this tyme. And though perhappes it might ſeme not much to enforce her title: yet may it ſerue to proue her no ſtranger to England, being of ſo long continuance, and ſo many wayes deſcended of the kings, and Royal blood of that Realme. But the Argumentes and prouffes, whiche we meane to alleage and bring forth for the confirmation of her right and title in Succeſſion (as Heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) to the Croune of England, are gathered and grounded vpon the lawes of God and nature: and not onely receaued in the Ciuile policies of other nations, but alſo in the olde lawes and Cuſtomes of the Realme of England, by reaſon approued, &amp; by vſage and longe continuance of tyme obſerued, from the firſt conſtitution of that Realme in politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8941:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
order, vnto this preſent day.</p>
            <p>And yet for all that, hath it bene, and yet is, by ſome men attempted, artificiallye to obiecte and caſte many myſtie darke cloudes before mennes eyes, to kepe from them (if it may be) the cleare light of the ſayd iuſt title, the whiche they would extinguiſh, or at the leaſt blemiſh with ſome obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſhadow of lawe, but in deede againſt the lawe: and with the ſhadowe of Parlamentes, but in deede againſt the true meaning of the Parlamentes.</p>
            <p>And though it were enough for vs (our cauſe being ſo firmely and ſuerly eſtabliſhed vpon all good reaſon and lawe) to ſtande at defence: and only to auoide (as eaſely we may) their obiections, whiche principally and chiefly are grounded vpon the common lawes and Statutes of that Realme: yet, for the bettering and ſtrengthening of the ſame, we ſhall Lay forth ſundrie great &amp; inuincible reaſons, conioyned with good and ſufficient authoritie of the lawe, ſo approued and confirmed, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries ſhal neuer be able iuſtly to impugne them: And ſo, as we truſt, after the reading of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and the effectes of the ſame well digeſted, no maner of ſcruple ought to remaine in any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent mans hart, concerning her right and title.</p>
            <p>VVhoſe expectation and conſcience allthough we truſte fully in this Diſcourſe to ſatiſfie, &amp; doubt nothing of the righteouſnes of our cauſe: yet muſt we nedes confeſſe, the manner &amp; forme to entreate therof to be full of difficulty &amp; perplexity. For ſuch cauſes of Princes, as they be ſeldome and rare, ſo is it more rare &amp; ſtrange, to finde them diſcourſed, diſcuſſed and determined by any lawe or ſtatute: albeit nowe &amp; then ſome ſtatutes tende that waye.<note place="margin">Inſt. de iuſt &amp; iure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For the proofe whereof let vs conſider, what the common lawe of that Realme is, and how the rules thereof be grounded and do take place. It is very manifeſte and plaine,<note place="margin">In Prologo ſuo eiuſde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. li. fo. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; <hi>2.</hi> De dict.

            <p>This thing being ſo true, as with any reaſon or good authoritie it can not be denied: then we are further to conſider, whether the kinges title to the Croune can be examined, tried and ordered by this common Cuſtome, or no. Yf it may: then muſt yt be proued by ſome recorde, that it hath bene ſo vſed: otherwiſe the aduerſaries only ſay it, and nothing at all proue it.

of the Croune. For there the ſucceſſour ſhall haue them, and not the executour, as appeareth in 7. H. 4. by Gaſcoine.

               <p>But to this the aduerſaries wold ſeeme to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in their ſaid booke, ſayeing, that Henry the ſeuenth, not with ſtanding his attainder, came to the Croune, as caſte vpon him by the order of the lawe: for ſo much as when the Croune was caſte vpon him, that diſhabilitie ceaſſed. VVherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe directly, that the Attainder is no diſhabilitie at all to the ſucceſsion of the Croune. For although no diſhabilitie can be alleaged in him, that hath the Croune in poſſeſsion: yet if there were any diſhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in him before to receue and take the ſame by lawful ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then muſt they ſay, that he was not lawful King, but an vſurpet. And therfore in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing Henry the ſeuenth to be a lawful king, and that the Croune was lawfully caſte vpon him, they confeſſe directly thereby, that before he was kinge in poſſeſsion, there was no diſhabilitie in him to take the Croune by lawful ſucceſsion, his ſaid At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder not withſtanding, whiche is as muche as I would wiſh them to graunt.</p>
               <p>But in concluſion, vnderſtanding them ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:8941:28"/>
that this their reaſon can not mainteine their intent:<note place="margin">An aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere to the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainder &amp; the birth out of the allegeance.</note> they goe about an other way to helpe them ſelues, making a difference in the lawe betwene the caſe of Attainder, &amp; the caſe of foraine birth out of the kinges allegeance: ſayeinge, that in the caſe of the Attainder neceſsitie doth enforce the ſucceſsion of the Croune vpon the partie attaynted. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they ſay, the Croune ſhall not deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to any. But vpon the birth out of the kinges allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they ſay, it is otherwiſe. And for proofe thereof they put a caſe of I. S. being ſeaſed of landes, and hauing iſſue A. and B. A. is attainted in the life of I. S. his father: and after I. S. dieth, A. liuing vnreſtored. Nowe the lande ſhal not deſcende either to A. or B. but ſhal goe to the Lorde of the Fee by way of eſchete. Otherwiſe it had bene (they ſay) if A. had bene borne beyond the ſea, I. S. breaking his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to the king, and after I. S. cometh agayne into the Realme, and hath iſſue B. and dieth: for now (they ſay) B. ſhall inherite his fathers Landes.</p>
               <p>Yf the Croune had bene holden of any perſon, to whome it might haue eſcheted, as in theyr caſe of I. S. the lande did: then peraduenture there had bene ſome affinitie betwene theyr ſaid caſe, and the caſe of the Croune. But there is no ſuche matter. Byſides that they muſte conſider, that the king co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Croune, not onely by deſcent, but alſo &amp; chiefly by ſucceſsion, as vnto a corporation. And therefore they might eaſely haue ſene a difference in theyr caſes betwene the kinges Maieſtie, and I. S. a ſubiecte: And alſo betwene landes holden of a Lorde aboue, &amp; the Croune holden of no earthly Lorde, but of God almighty onely.</p>
               <p>But yet for arguments ſake I woulde faine knowe, where they finde their difference, and what authoritie they can ſhew for the proof thereof?
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8941:28"/>
They haue made no marginal note of any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: &amp; therefore vnleſſe they alſo ſaye, that they are Pythagoras, I will not beleue theyr difference. VVel, I am aſſured, that I can ſhew good outhoritie to the contrarie, and that there is no difference in theyr caſes. Yf they peruſe. 22. H. 6:<note place="margin">22. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 43.</note> there may they ſee the opinion of Iuſtice Newton, that there is no difference in theyr caſes: but that in both theyr ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the lande ſhall eſchete vnto the Lorde. And Priſote, being then of Counſaile with the party that clamed lands by a deſcent, wher the eldeſt ſonne was borne beyond the ſeas, durſt not abide in lawe vpon the title. This authoritie is againſt theyr dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; this authoritie I am well aſſeured is better, then any that they haue ſhewed to proue their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. But if we ſhall admit their difference to be according to the lawe: yet their caſes, where vnto they applie their difference, are nothing like, as I haue ſaid before. Now then, to procede on in the proofe of our purpoſe, as it doth appeare, that neither the King, nor his Croune is bound by theſe generall rules, whiche before I haue ſhewed: ſo do I likewiſe ſay of all the reſidue of the general rules &amp; Maximes of the lawe, being in a manner infinite.<note place="margin">The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not Kinges borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſea, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by King Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen and King H. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> But to retourne againe vnto their onely ſuppoſed Maxime, whiche they make ſo general, concerning the diſhabilitie of perſones borne beyond the ſeas: it is very plaine, that it was neuer taken, to extende vnto the Croune of the Realme of Englande, as it may appeare by king Stephen, and by king Henry the ſecond, who were both ſtraungers and Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemen, borne out of the kinges allegeance, and neither were they kinges children immediate, nor their parentes of the allegeance: and yet they haue bene alwaies accompted lawfull kinges of England: nor their title was by any man at any time defaced

or comptrolled for any ſuche conſideration or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of foraine birth.</p>

They ſay, he came not to the Croune by order of the lawe, but by capitulation, for aſmuche as his mother, by whome he conueied his Title, was then liuing. VVell, admitte that he came to the Croune by capitulation, during his mothers life: yet this doth not proue, that he was diſhabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Croune, but rather proueth his abylitie. And although I did alſo admit, that he had not the Croune by order of the lawe during his mothers life: yet after his mothers death, no man hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doubted, but that he was king by lawfull ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not againſt the lawes and Cuſtomes of that Realme. For ſo might they put a doubt in all the Kinges of that Realme, that euer gouerned ſithens. VVhiche thing we ſuppoſe they are ouer wiſe to goe about.</p>
               <p>Byſides this, I haue hard ſome of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for further helpe of their intention in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſay, that king Henry the ſecond was a Queenes childe, &amp; ſo king by the rule of the common lawe. Truely I know, he was an Empereſſe childe, but no Queene of Englandes childe. For although Maude the Empereſſe, his mother, had a right and a good title to the Croune, and to be Queene of England, yet was ſhe neuer in poſſeſsion, but kepte from the poſſeſsion, by king Stephen. And therefore king Henry the ſecond can not iuſtly be ſayed, to be a Queene of Englandes childe, nor yet any kynges childe, vnleſſe ye would intend the kinges children, by the wordes of <hi>Infantes de Roy &amp;c,</hi> to be children of further degree, &amp; deſcended from the right line of the king: for ſo ye might ſay truely, that he was

               <p>And therefore they would (for the maintenance of theyr pretenſed Maxime) catche ſome holde vpon Arthur the ſonne of Ieffrey, one of the ſonnes of the ſaide Henry the ſeconde. They ſay then, like good and ioly Antyquaries, that he was reiected from the Croune, bycauſe he was borne out of the Realme. That he was borne out of the Realme, it is very true: but that he was reiected from the Croune for that cauſe, it is very falſe. Neither haue they any authoritie to proue theyr vaine opinion in this pointe. For it is to be proued by the Croni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of that Realme, that king Richarde the firſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle vnto the ſayd Arthur, taking his iourney toward Hieruſalem, declared the ſaid Arthur (as we haue declared before) to be heire apparent vnto the Croune: which would not haue bene if he had bene taken to be vnhable to receaue the Croune by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of foraine birth.</p>
               <p>And although king Iohn did vſurpe, aſwell upon the ſaid king Richard the firſt, his eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as alſo vpon the ſayd Arthur his nephewe: yet that is no proof, that he was reiected, bycauſe he was borne out of the Realme. Yf theſe menne could proue that, then had they ſhewed ſome reaſon and preſident to proue their intent, whereas hytherto they haue ſhewed none at all, nor, I am wel aſſured, ſhall euer be able to ſhewe.</p>
               <p>Thus may ye ſee, gentle Reader, that neither this pretenſed Maxime of the lawe ſet forth by the Aduerſaries, nor a great nomber more, as general as this is (whiche before I haue ſhewed) can by any reaſonable meanes be ſtretched, to bind the Croune
<pb facs="tcp:8941:30"/>
of England. Theſe reaſons and authorities may for this time ſuffice, to proue, that the Croune of that Realme is not ſubiecte to the rules and the Principles of the common lawe, neither can be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and tried by the ſame. VVhiche thing being true, all the obiections of the Aduerſaries made againſt the title of Marie the Queene of Scotland to the ſucceſsion of the Croune of that Realme, are fully anſwered, and thereby clearly wiped away. Yet for further arguments ſake, and to the ende we might haue all matters ſifted to the vttermoſt, and therby all things made plaine: let vs, for this tyme, ſomewhat yeelde vnto the Aduerſaries, admitting; that the Title of the Croune of that Realme were to be examined and tried by the rules and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the common lawe: and then let vs conſider and examin further, whether ther be any rule of the common lawe, or els any ſtatute, that by good &amp; iuſt conſtruction can ſeeme to impugne the ſaid title of Marie the Queene of Scotland, or no. For touching her lineal deſcente from king Henry the ſeuenth, and by his eldeſt daughter (as we haue ſhewed) there is no man ſo impudent to denie. VVhat is there then to be obiected among all the rules, Maximes, and iugements of the common law of that Realm? Only one rule, as a general Maxime, is obiected againſt her. And yet the ſame rule is ſo vntruely ſet forth, that I can not well agree, that it is any rule or Maxime of the common lawe of the Realme of England. Their pretenſed Maxime is, whoſoeuer is borne out of the realme of England, and of father and mother, not being vnder the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the king of England,<note place="margin">A falſe Maxime ſet forth by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. <hi>7.</hi> E. <hi>4.</hi> fol. <hi>28. 9.</hi> E. <hi>4</hi> fol. <hi>5. 11.</hi> H. <hi>4.</hi> fol. <hi>25. 14.</hi> H. <hi>4.</hi> fol. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> cannot be capable to inherite any thing in England. VVhiche rule is nothing true, but altogether falſe. For euery ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Alien is hable to purchace the inheritance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8941:30"/>
of landes within that Realm, as it may appeare in 7. &amp; 9. of king Edward the fourth, and alſo in 11. &amp; 14. of king Henrie the fourth. And although the ſame purchaſſe is of ſome men accounted to be to the vſe of the king: yet vntill ſuch time as the king be intitled there vnto by matter of Record, the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance remaineth in the Alien by the opinion of all men. And ſo is a very Alien capable of inheritance within that Realme. And then it muſt nedes fall out verye plainlye, that this generall Maxime, where vpon the aduerſaries haue talked and bragged ſo muche, is now become no rule of the common lawe of that Realme. And if it be ſo: then haue they vtered very many woordes to ſmall purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But yet let vs ſee further, whether there be any rule or Maxime in the common lawe, that may ſeeme any thing like to that rule, wherevpon any matter may be gathered againſt the title of the ſaid Marie Queene of Scotland. There is one rule of the common lawe, in woordes ſome what like vnto that, whiche hath bene alleaged by the aduerſaries. VVhich rule is ſet forth and declared by a ſtatute made anno 25. of king Edward the third. VVhiche ſtatute reciting the doubt that then was, whether infants borne out of the allegeance of England, ſhould be hable to demaund any heritage within the ſame allegeance, or no: it was by the ſame ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ordeined, that all infantes inheritours, whiche after that time ſhould be borne out of the allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the king, whoſe father and mother at the time of their birth, were of the faith and allegeance of the king of England, ſhould enioy the ſame benefittes and aduantages, to haue and holde heritage within the ſaid allegeance, as other heires ſhould. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is to be gathered by dew &amp; iuſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruction of the ſame ſtatute, and hath bene heretofore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb facs="tcp:8941:31"/>
taken, that the common lawe alwayes was, &amp; yet is, that no perſone born out of the allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the king of England, whoſe father and mother were not of the ſame allegeance, ſhould be able to haue or demaund any heritage within the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, as heire to any perſon. VVhiche rule I take to be the ſame ſuppoſed Maxime, that the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do meane. But to ſtretche it generally to all inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces (as the aduerſaries woulde ſeeme to do) by any reaſonable meanes can not be.<note place="margin">The ſtatute of Edvv. <hi>3.</hi> An. <hi>25.</hi> touchetb in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beritance, not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. <hi>11.</hi> H. <hi>4.</hi> fol. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note> For (as I haue ſaid before) euery ſtranger and Alien borne, may haue and take inheritance, as a purchaſer. And if an Alien do Marie a woman inheritable, the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance therby is both in the Alien, &amp; alſo in his wife, &amp; the Alien thereby a purchaſer. No man doubteth, but that a Denizon maye purchaſe landes to his owne vſe: but to inherit landes, as heire to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within the allegeance of England, he can not by any meanes. So that it ſeemeth very plaine, that the ſaid rule bindeth alſo Denyzons, &amp; doth onely extend to Deſcentes of inheritance, and not to the hauing of any lande by purchſe.</p>
               <p>Now will we then conſider, whether this rule by any reaſonable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruction can extend vnto the Lady Marie the Queene of Scotland, for and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her title to the Croune of England. It hath bene ſaid by the Aduerſaries that ſhe was borne in Scotland, whiche realm is out of the allegeance of England, her father and mother not being of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: &amp; therfore by the ſaid rule, ſhe is not inheritable to the Croune of England. Though. I might at the beginning very wel and orderly deny the conſequent of this argumente: yet I wil firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin the Antecedent, euen by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion and ſentence of Engliſh men: then will I conſider vpon the conſequent. And this I intend, of purpoſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8941:31"/>
only to diſcouer the improuidence of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, whiche in a matter, where they couet moſt to looke vnto them ſelues, there they leaſt of all prouide for the warrantize of theyr cauſe by their owne pretenſed lawes of the Realme of England. But I mynde not hereupon ſo to ouer rule the matter, as any preiudice may thereby be created againſt the Kynges of Scotland: who haue alwayes kept, and ſtill doe kepe and enioye, with a plain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion &amp; moſt iuſt clame in their owne right, ouer their ſubiectes a ſupreme authoritie, &amp; power, not depending by any lawe right or cuſtome vpon any other Prince or potentate in the world. VVell then (to come to the Antecedent) ſo it is, that the Queene of Scotland was borne in Scotland, it muſt nedes be graunted: but that Scotland is out of the allegeance of England, though the ſayde Queene, and all her ſubiectes doe iuſtlye affirme the ſame, yet there is a verie greate number of men in England, both learned and others, whiche are not of that opinion, but earneſtly auouche the contrary, being led &amp; perſuaded therunto (as they ſay) by diuerſe Hiſtories, Regiſters, Recordes, and Inſtruments, remayninge in the Treaſurie of that Realme: wherin is mentioned (as they alſo ſaye) that the Kynges of Scotland haue acknouleged the Kyng of England to be the ſuperiour Lorde ouer the Realme of Scotland, &amp; haue done homage and fealtie for the ſame. VVhich being true, though all Scotſmen denie it, as Iuſtlie they may: for the homage &amp; fealtie whiche thoſe men ſpeake of was not exhibited nor done in any ſuch reſpect as they ſurmiſe, but in conſideration of the tenures of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein Segnories, Lands, tenements, &amp; hereditaments lyeing in Northumberland, Cumberland, &amp; other Shyres of England, whiche now the Kinges of
<pb facs="tcp:8941:32"/>
Scotland want, and then did enioye &amp; holde of the Kyng of England: As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie it is ſene in ſondrie parts of Chriſtindome Kyngs and Princes hauyng diſtinct and abſolute regiments, not depending of any other potentate, to holde neuertheleſſe one of an other diuerſe landes townes and countries lyeing within the marches of the one or the others dominions. But admit it to be true whiche theſe men doe ſo auouche: then Scotlande muſt nedes be accompted within the allegeance of England, euen by their owne lawes of the ſame Realme, and by the common opinion of their owne nation. And although ſins the tyme of Kinge Henry the ſixt, none of the Kinges of Scotlande haue done the ſaid ſeruice vnto the Kinges of England: yet that is no reaſon in the lawe of England to ſaye, that therefore the Realme of Scotland at the tyme of the birth of the ſayd Ladie Marie Queene of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, being in the thirtie and fourth yeare of the raigne of the late Kinge Henrie the eight, was out of the allegeance of the Kinges of England. For the lawe of that Realme is very plain, that though the Tenant do not his ſeruice vnto the Lorde, yet hath not the Lord thereby loſt his Seignorie.<note place="margin">The Lorde loſeth not his ſeigno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie, though the tenante doth not his ſeruice.</note> For the lande ſtill remaineth within his Fee &amp; Seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>But peraduenture ſome will obiecte and ſaye, that by this reaſon, France ſhould likewiſe be ſaid to be within the allegeance of England: foraſmuch as the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Croune of France hath bene within a litle more then the ſpace of one hundred yeares nowe laſt paſt, laufully veſted in the Kinges of England, whoſe right and title ſtill remaineth.</p>
               <p>To that obiection it may be anſwered, that there is a great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the right &amp; title, which the kings of England clame to the Realm of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8941:32"/>
&amp; the right &amp; title which they clame to the Realme of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For although it be true, that the kings of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue bene lawfully poſſeſſed of the Croune of France: yet during ſuch time, as they by vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, are diſpoſſeſſed of the ſaid Realme of Fraunce: the ſame Realme by no meanes can be ſaid to be within their allegeance: eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, how that ſyns the time of vſurpation, the people of France haue wholy forſaken their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they did owe vnto the kings of England, &amp; haue geuen &amp; ſubmitted them ſelues vnder the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſh. But as for the Realme of Scotlande, it is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>For the Title, whiche the Kinges of England (by the opinion of theſe men) may clame to the Realme of Scotland, is not in the poſſeſsion of the lande and Croune of Scotlande: but onely in the ſeruice of homage and fealtie for the ſame: And though the Kinges of Scotland, many yeres, haue intermitted to doe the ſaid homage &amp; fealtie vnto the Kinges of Englande: yet for all that the Kinges of Scotland can not by any reaſon or lawe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vſurpers, and vniuſt poſſeſſors.</p>
               <p>And thus all indifferente men, not ledd by affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may well ſee, by the recordes &amp; teſtimonies of England, that the Realme of Scotlande, is within the allegeance of England. And ſo is the Antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or firſt propoſition falſe. And yet that maketh no proufe, that the Realme of France likewiſe ſhould nowe be ſayde to be within the allegeance of the Kings of England, by reaſon of the manifeſt and apparent difference before ſhewed.</p>
               <p>But what if the antecedent were true? (as the aduerſaries ſaye it is, and all Scotſmen conſtantly affirme it to be.) Yet it is very plaine, that the ſayde conſequent and concluſion can not by any meanes
<pb facs="tcp:8941:33"/>
be true:<note place="margin">The cauſes vvhy the Croune can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed vvithin the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Maxime.</note> and that principallye, for three cauſes: whereof one is, for that neyther the Kinge, nor the Croune (not being ſpecially mentioned in the ſaid rule or pretended Maxime) can be intended to be within the meaning of the ſame Maxime, as we haue before ſufficently proued by a great number of other ſuche like generall rules and Maximes of the lawes. An other cauſe is, for that the Croune can not be taken to be within the woordes of the ſaid ſuppoſed Maxime: and that for twoo reſpectes: one is, bicauſe the rule doth onely diſhable Aliens to demaunde any heritage within the allegeance of England. VVhiche rule can not be ſtretched to the demaunde of the Croune of England, which is not with in the allegeance of England: but is the verie allegeance it ſelfe. As for a like example: it is true, that all the landes within the Kinges dominion are holden of the Kinge, either mediatly, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly: and yet it is not true, that the Croune (by whiche onely the Kinge hath his Dominion) can be ſaid to be holden of the King.<note place="margin">VVithout the Croune there can neither be King nor allegeance.</note> For without the Croune there can be neither King, nor allegeance. And ſo long as the Croune reſteth onelye in demaunde, not being veſted in any perſone, ther is no allegeance at all. So that the Croune can not be ſaide by any meanes to be within the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of England: and therfore not within the wordes of the ſaid rule or Maxime. The title of the Croune is alſo out of the wordes and meaning of the ſame rule in an other reſpect: and that is, bicauſe that rule doth onely diſhable an Alien to demaund landes by deſcent as heire. For it doth not extend vnto landes purchaſed by an Alien, as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently proued. And then can not that rule extende vnto the Croune being a thinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate: the right wherof doth not deſcend

               <p>No man doubteth, but that a Prior Alien being no denizon, might alwayes in time of peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund land in the right of his corporation. And ſo likewiſe a Deane or a Perſon being Aliens, &amp; no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizons, might demaund lande, in reſpecte of their corporations, not withſtanding the ſaid ſuppoſed rule or Maxime, as may appeare by diuerſe booke caſes, as alſo by the ſtatute made in the time of king Richard the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And although the Croune hath alwaies gone according to the common courſe of a Deſcent: yeth doth it not properly deſcende, but ſuccede. And that is the reaſon of the lawe, that, although the Kinge be more fauoured in all his doinges, then any common perſon ſhalbe: yet can not the King by lawe auoide his grauntes &amp; Letters Patentes by reaſon of his Nonage, as other infantes may doe, but ſhall alwayes be ſaid to be of full age in reſpect of his Croune: euen as a Perſon, Vicare or Deane, or any other perſon incorporate ſhalbe. VVhiche can not by any meanes be ſaid in lawe, to be within age in reſpect of their corporations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the corporation be but one yere olde.</p>
               <p>Byſides that, the Kinge can not by the lawe auoide the Letters Patentes made by any vſurper of the Croune (vnleſſe it be by acte of Parlement) no more then other perſones incorporate ſhall auoide the grauntes made by one that was before wrongfullye in their places and romes: whereas in Deſcentes of inheritance the lawe is otherwiſe. For there the heire may auoide all eſtates made by the diſſeaſour, or abatour, or any other perſone, whoſe eſtate is by lawe defeated. VVhereby it doth plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely appeare, that the King is incorporate vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:8941:34"/>
Croune,<note place="margin">The King is alvvaies at full age in reſpecte of his Croune.</note> &amp; hath the ſame properly by ſucceſsion and not by Deſcent onely. And that is likewiſe an other reaſon, to proue, that the Kinge and the Croune can neither be ſayde to be within the wordes, nor yet with in the meaning of the ſayde generall rule or Maxime.</p>
               <p>The third and moſt principall cauſe of all is, for that in the ſaid ſtatute, wherupon the ſaid ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed rule or Maxime is gathered,<note place="margin">The Kings childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are expreſly excepted from the ſurmiſed Maxime.</note> the children deſcendantes and deſcended of the blood royall by the wordes of <hi>Infantes de Roy</hi> are expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of the ſayd ſuppoſed rule or Maxime.

and reſt for the time, with a good and ſure hope of quiet and peaceable entrance alſo after the death of King Stephen. and ſo it followed in deede: but ther grew to him nomore right thereby, than was due to him before. For he was the true heir to the Croune, as appeareth by Stephen his Aduerſaries owne confeſsion. Henry the firſte maried his dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter Mathildis to Henry the Emperour, by who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he had no children. And no dout in caſe ſhe had had any children by the Emperour, they ſhould haue ben heires by ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Croune of England. After whoſe death ſhe retourned to her father: yet did king Henry cauſe all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie by an expreſſe othe, to embrace her after his death as Queene, and afrer her, her children.</p>
               <p>Not long after, ſhe was maried to Ieffrey Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet a Frenchman borne, Earle of Aniowe, who begat of her this Henry the ſecond, being in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

And for ſuch a one is he taken in all our ſtories. And for ſuch a one did all the worlde take him, after the ſaid King Richard his death: neither was King Iohn taken for other, than for an vſurper by excluding him: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for a murtherer, for impriſoning him, and priuily making him away.<note place="margin">The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions of the Croune of England that vvere beyond the ſeas, ſeaſed into the Frenche kings ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds for the murther of Arthur</note> For the whiche facte the French king ſeaſed vpon all the goodly Countries in Fraunce belonging to the kinge of England, as forfeited to him being the chiefe Lorde.

To the whiche the
<pb facs="tcp:8941:40"/>
prudent and wiſe king anſwered,<note place="margin">King. H. <hi>7.</hi> vvith his Counſaile is a good interpretor of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cauſe.</note> that in caſe any ſuche deuolution ſhould happen, it would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preiudiciall to England. For England, as the chief, and principal, and worthieſt parte of the Ile, ſhould drawe Scotland to it, as it did Normandie from the time of the Conqueſt. VVhich anſwere was wonderfully well liked of all the Counſaile. And ſo conſequently the Mariage toke effect, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth by Polydor, the Hiſtoriographer of that Realme, and ſuche a one, as wrote the Actes of that time by the inſtruction of the king him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, the worthy wiſe Salomon foreſeeing that ſuch deuolution might happen, was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretour with his prudente and ſage Counſaile for our cauſe. For els, they neaded not to reaſon of any ſuch ſubiection to Scotlande, if the children of the Ladie Margaret might not lawfully inherite the Croune of England. For, as to her huſband Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d could not be ſubiect, hauing him ſelfe no right by this mariage to the Title of the Croune of that Realme. VVherevpon I may well inferre, that the ſaid newe Maxime of theſe men (whereby they would rule, and ouer rule the ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Princes) was not knowen to the ſaid wiſe king, neither to any of his Counſaile: Or if it were, yet was it taken not to reache to his blood royall borne in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande. And ſo on euery ſide the Title of my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lady Queene Marie is aſſured. So that now by this that we haue ſaid, it may eaſely be ſeen, by what light and ſlender co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration the aduerſaries haue gone about to ſtrayne the worde <hi>Infantes</hi> or children to the firſt degree only. Of the like weight is their other conſideration imagining and ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, this ſtatute to be made, bicauſe the king had ſo many occaſions to be ſo oft ouer the ſea with his ſpouſe the Queene. As though diuers kings before

VVhiche to ſay, is moſt directely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant and contrary to the letter of the ſaid ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: Or as though his children alſo did not very often repaire to outward Countries:<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of King E. <hi>3.</hi> ſonnes.</note> as Iohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaſtre, that Maried Peters the king of Caſtiles eldeſt daughter, by whoſe right he clamed the Croune of Caſtile: as his brother Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Erle of Camhridge, that maried the yongeſt daughter: as Lionell Duke of Clarence, that maried at Milaine Violant daughter and heir to Galeatius Duke of Milan: But eſpecialy Prince Edwarde, whiche moſte victoriouſly toke in battaile Iohn the French King, and brought him into England his priſoner, to the great triumphe and reioyſing of the realme, whoſe eldeſt ſonne Edward (that died in ſhort time after,) was borne beyond the ſeas in Gaſcoine, and his other ſonne Richard (that ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his grandfather) was borne at Burdeaux. And as theſe noble King Edwardes ſonnes maried with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers: ſo did they geue out their daughters in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to foraine Princes, as the Duke of Lancaſter, his daughter Philip to the King of Portugall: and his daughter Catherin to the king of Spaine: &amp; his Neece Iohan, daughter to his ſonne Erle of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, was ioyned in mariage to the king of Scottes: Iohan, daughter to his brother Thomas of wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocke Duke of Glouceſter was Queene of Spaine: and his other daughter, Marie, Ducheſſe of Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie.</p>
               <p>Now by theſe mennes interpretation, none of the iſſue of all theſe noble women could haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed the Croune of England, when it had fallen to them (though they had bene of the neereſt roial blood) after the death of their Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſtours. VVhich

ſurely had bene againſt the auncient preſidentes &amp; examples that we haue declared, and againſt the common Lawe (the whiche muſt not be thought by this Statute any thing taken away, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) and againſt all good reaſon alſo. For as the kings of England would haue thought that Realme greatly iniuried, if it had bene defrauded of Spaine or any of the foreſaid countreies, being deuolued to the ſame by the foreſaid Mariages: ſo the iſſue of the foreſaide noble women might and would haue thought them hardly and iniuriouſly handled, yf any ſuch caſe had happened.

For being then a Maxime (ſaie they) in the lawe, that none could inherite to his Aunceſtours being not of father and mother vnder the obedience of the king: ſeing the king him ſelfe could not be vnder obedience: it plainely ſeemed, that the kinges chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren were of farre worſe condition, than others, &amp; quite excluded. And therefore they ſaie that this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was not to geue them any other priuilege, but to make them equall with other.

in this ſtatute mentioned,<note place="margin">There vvas no doubt made of the Kinges children borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde the ſeas.</note> muſt be taken for the children of the firſt degree, whiche they ſeeme to proue by a note taken out of M.

For this was no Maxime, or at leaſt not ſo certaine, before the making of this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: whiche geueth no new right to the kinges children, nor anſwereth any doubt touching them, and their inheritance: but this it ſaieth, that the law of the Croune of England is, and alwaies hath bene (which lawe, ſaith the king, ſay the Lordes, ſay the Commons, we allowe &amp; affirme for euer) that the kinges children ſhalbe hable to inherite the landes of their Aunceſters, whereſoeuer they be borne.</p>
               <p>All the doubt was for other perſones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly by the tenour of the ſtatute) whether by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law they being born out of the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the king, were heritable to their Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours.

only the ſucceſſion of the Kings children to their Aunceſtours for other inheritance, and not for the Croune, as moſte men take it, and as it may be (as we haue ſaid) very well taken and allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed: then doeth this ſuppoſed Maxime of forain borne, that ſeemeth to be gathered out of this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, nothing anoy or hinder the Queene of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes Title to the Croune, as not therto appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the other ſide, if by the inheritance of the Kings children, the Croune alſo is meant: yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we enforce the rule of foraine borne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kings childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are by the expreſſe wordes of the ſtatute excepted, neither enforce the word <hi>Infants</hi> to the firſt degree onely, for ſuch reaſons preſidents, and examples, and other proouffes lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely by vs before ſet forth to the contrarie: ſeing that the right of the Croune falling vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they may well be called the kings Children, or at the leſt the children of the Croune.

For the ſaid ſtatute can not be vnderſtanded of any perſones borne in Scotlande or wales, but onely of perſones borne beyond the ſea, out of the allegeance of the king of England: that is to witte, France, Fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dres, &amp; ſuch like For England, Scotland and wales be all within one Territorie, and not diuided by any ſea.

Normane French, whiche haue theſe wordes, <hi>deins les quatre mers,</hi> that is, within the fower ſeas. Nowe concerninge the ſtatute, the title of the ſame is, of thoſe that are born beyond the ſea: the doubt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the corps of the ſaid ſtatute, is alſo of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne beyond the ſea out of the allegeance,<note place="margin">Vide ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta VValliae in magna Charta. VVales vvas vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the allegeance of England before it vvas vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Croune.</note> with diuers other branches of the ſtatute tending that way. VVherby it ſeemeth, that no part of the ſtatute toucheth theſe that are born in VVales or Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And albeit at this time, and before in the reigne of Edward the firſt, VVales was fully reduced, anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed &amp; vnited to the proper Dominion of England: yet was it before ſubiected to the Croune and King of England, as to the Lorde and Seigniour. VVherefore if this ſtatute had bene made before the time of the ſaid Edward the firſt: it ſemeth, that it could not haue bene ſtretched to VVales, no more then it can now to Scotland. I doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a litle meruaile, that euer theſe men, for pure ſhame, could finde in their hartes ſo childiſhly to wrangle vpon this word <hi>Infants,</hi> and ſo openly to detort, depraue, and corrupt the common law, and the Actes of Parlament.</p>
               <p>And thus may you ſee, gentle Reader, that nothing can be gathered, either out of the ſaide ſuppoſed generall rule or Maxime, or of any other rule or Principle of the lawe, that by any good and reaſonable conſtruction can ſeeme to impugne the title of my ſaid ſoueraign Lady Mary now Queene of Scotland, of, and to the Croune of the Realme of England, as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>VVe are therefore now laſt of all to conſider, whether there be any ſtatute or acte of Parlament, that doth ſeeme, either to take away, or preiudice the title of the ſaid Queene. And bycauſe touching the foreſaid mentioned ſtatute of the 25. yere of

King Edward the thirde, being onely a declaration of the common lawe, we haue already ſufficiently anſwered: we will paſſe it ouer, and conſider vpon the ſtatute of 28 and 35. of King Henrye the eight, being the onely ſhoteanker of all the Aduerſaries, whether there be any matter therein conteined or depending vpon the ſame, that can by any meanes deſtroye or hurt the title of the ſaid Queene of Scotland to the ſucceſsion of the Croune of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</p>

and vehement preſumptions, that, for the fatherly loue that he bare to the common wealth, and for the auoiding of the vncerteintie of the ſucceſsion, he well liked vpon and accepted the authoritie geuen him by Parlament, and ſigned with his owne hande the ſaid originall will, whiche had the ſaid limitation and aſsignation of the Croune.</p>
               <p>And theſe preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are the more enforced, for that he had no cauſe, why he ſhould beare any affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either to the ſaid Queene of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or to the Lady Leneux: and hauing withal no cauſe to be greeued or offended with his ſiſters, the Frenche Queenes children: but to put the matter quite out of all ambiguitie and doubte, it appeareth (they ſay) that there were eleuen witneſſes purpoſely called by the King, who were preſent at the ſigning of the ſaid VVill, and ſubſcribed their names to the ſame: Yea that the chief Lordes of the Counſaile were made and appointed executours of the ſaid VVill, and that they and other had greate Legacies geuen them in the ſaid VVill, which were paid, and other thinges, compriſed in the VVill, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed accordingly.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8941:45"/>
to make vs to thinke, that as the king neuer had good and iuſte cauſe, to minde &amp; enterpriſe ſuche an Acte, as is pretended: ſo likewiſe he did enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe no ſuch Acte in deede. I deny not, but that ther was ſuch authoritie geuen him: neither I deny, but that he might alſo in ſome honorable ſort haue practiſed the ſame, to the honour and wealthe of the Realme, and to the good contentation of the ſame Realme. But that he had either cauſe, or did exerciſe the ſaid authoritie in ſuche ſtrange &amp; diſhonorable ſort, as is pretended: I plainely denie. For being at the time of this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed will furniſhed and adorned with iſſue, the late king Edward, and the Ladies Marie, and Elizabeth, their ſtate and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion being alſo lately by Acte of Parlament eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: what neede or likelyhod was there, for the king then to practiſe ſuch newe deuiſes, as neuer did, I ſuppoſe, any King in that Realme before, and fewe in any other byſide? And where they were practiſed, commonly had infortunate and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>VVhat likelyhode was there, for him to practiſe ſuch deuiſes, eſpecially in his later daies (when wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the loue of God, and his Realm ſhould haue bene moſte ripe in him) that were likely to ſturre vppe a greater fier of greeuouſe contention and wofull deſtruction in England, then euer did the deadly faction of the read Roſe &amp; the white, lately by the incorporation and vnion of the houſe of Yorke and Lancaſtre, in the perſon of his father through the mariage of Ladye Elizabeth, eldeſt daughter of King Edwarde the fourth, moſte happily extinguiſhed and buried? And though it might be thought or ſaid, that there vould be no ſuch cauſe of feare, by reaſon the matter paſſed by Parlament: yet could not he be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that neither
<pb facs="tcp:8941:46"/>
Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts made for He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the fourth, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of twoo Deſcentes (which toke no place in geuing any Title touching the Croune) in King Henry the ſixt: nor Parlamentes made for King Richard the third, nor Parlaments of attainder made againſt his father, could either preiudice his fathers right, or releaue other againſt ſuch, as pretended iuſt right and title.</p>
               <p>And as he could not be ignorant therof: ſo it is not to be thought, that he would abuſe the great confidence put vpon him by the Parlament, and diſherite without any apparent cauſe the next roial blood, and thinke all thinges ſure by the colour of Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: The litle force whereof againſt the right inheritour, he had (to his fathers and his owne ſo ample benefit) ſo lately and ſo largely ſene and felt. And yet if he minded at any time, to preiudice the ſaid Lady Marie Queene of Scotland, of all times he would not haue done it then, when all his care was, by all poſsible meanes to contriue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe a mariage, betwene his ſonne Edward, and the ſaid Lady and Queene. Surely he was to wiſe of him ſelfe, and was furniſhed with to wiſe Counſailours, to take ſuch an homely way, to procure and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the ſaid mariage by.</p>
               <p>And leaſt of all can we ſay he attempted that diſhonorable diſheriſon for any ſpeciall inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or fauour he bare to the French Queene, his ſiſters children. For there haue bene of his neere &amp; priuie Counſaile, that haue reported, that the King neuer had any great liking of the mariage of his ſiſter with the Duke of Suffolke, who maried her firſt priuily in France, and afterward openly in England: And, as it is ſaid, had his pardon for the ſaid priuy mariage in writing. Howeſoeuer this matter goeth, certeine it is, that if this pretenſed will be true, he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8941:46"/>
tranſferred and tranſpoſed the reuerſion of the Croune, not only from the Queene of Scotland, from the Ladie Leneux and their iſſue, but euen from the Lady Francis, &amp; the Ladie Eleonour alſo, daughters to the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che Queene, whiche is a thing in a manner incredible, and therefore nothing likely.</p>
               <p>I muſt now, gentle Reader, put thee in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of two other moſt pregnant and notable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures and preſumptions. For among all other inconueniences, and abſurdities, that do, and may accompanie this raſh &amp; vnaduiſed acte by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed wil inconſiderately mainteined: it is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be noted,<note place="margin">The ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vvill is preiudicial to the Croune of England for the clame of the Croune of France.</note> that this Acte geueth apparent &amp; iuſt occaſion of perpetual diſheriſon of the Style &amp; Title of France incorporated and vnited to the Croune of England. For whereby do or haue the Frenchemen hitherto excluded the kinges of that Realme, claming the Croune of France by the title of Edward the third, fallen vpon him by the right of his mother, other than by a politike and ciuil law of their owne, that barreth the female fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right of the Croune? And what doeth this pretenſed Act of king Henrie, but iuſtifie and ſtrengthen their quarel, and ouerthrow the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; bulworke, wherby the kings of England maintene their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid title and clame? For if they may by their muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipial lawe of England exclude the ſaid Queene of Scotland, being called to the Croune by the Title of generall heritage: then is the municipial law of France likewiſe good and effectual: &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the kings of England haue made all this while an vniuſt &amp; wrongfull clame to the Croune of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
               <p>But now to go ſomewhat further in the matter, or rather to come neerer home, and to touche the quicke, we ſay: as there was ſome apparent &amp; good
<pb facs="tcp:8941:47"/>
cauſe, why the king ſhould the twentie and eight yeare of his reigne thinke vpon ſome limitation &amp; appointement of the Croune (king Edward as yet vnborne:) ſo after he was borne, and that the Title and intereſt of the reuerſion of the Croune after him was the thirtie and fifte yeare by Parlament confirmed to the late Queene Marie and her ſiſter Queene Elizabeth: it is not to be thought, that he would afterward ieoparde ſo great a matter by a Teſtament and will, whiche may eaſely be altered and counterfeyted: and leaſt of all make ſuche aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation of the Croune, as is nowe pretended.</p>
               <p>For being a Prince of ſuch wiſdome and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he could not be ignorant, that this was the next and redieſt way, to put the ſtate at leaſt of both his daughters to great peril and vtter diſheriſon.<note place="margin">This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vvill geueth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ambitious aſpiring.</note> For the Kinges example and boldnes in interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting and cutting away ſo many branches of the neereſt ſide and line, might ſoone breede in aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ambitious hartes a bolde and wicked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte, the way being ſo farre brought in and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to their handes by the Kinge him ſelfe: and their natures ſo readie and prone to follow euil preſidents, and to clime high by ſome colourable meanes or other, to ſpoile and depriue the ſaid daughters of their right of the Croune, that ſhould deſcend and fal vpon them, and to conuey the ſame to the heires of the ſaid Ladie Francis. And did not, I pray you, this drift and deuiſe fall out euen ſo, tending to the vtter excluſion of the late Queene Marie, and her Siſter Queene Elizabeth: if God had not repreſſed and ouerthrowen the ſame?</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſones then &amp; preſumptions may ſeme wel able and ſufficient, to beare doune, to breake doune and ouerthrow the weake and ſlender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of the Aduerſaries, grounded vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8941:47"/>
and mere ſurmiſes, gheſſes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures: as among other that the king was offended with the Queene of Scotland, and with the Ladie Leneux. VVhich is not true. And as for the Ladie Leneux, it hath no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of probabilitie: as it hath not in dede in the ſaid Queene. And if it had: yet it is as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and much more probable, that the king would haue eſpecially at that time (for ſuche cauſe, as we haue declared) ſuppreſſed the ſame diſpleaſure. Graunting now, that there were ſome ſuch diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: was it honorable, either for the King, or the Realme: or was it, thinke ye, euer thought by the Parlament, that the king ſhould diſherite them for euery light diſpleaſure? And if (as the Aduerſaries confeſſe) the king had no cauſe to be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the Frenche Queenes children: why did he diſheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te the Ladie Francis, and the Ladie Eleonor alſo?</p>
               <p>Their other preſumption, which they ground, vpon the auoyding of the vncertenty of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion, by reaſon of his will, is of ſmal force and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turneth againſt them. For it is ſo farre of, that by this meanes the ſucceſsion is made more certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and ſure: as contrarywiſe it is ſubiecte to more vncerteintie, and to leſſe ſuertie, than before.<note place="margin">Succeſsion to the Croune more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certen by the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vvill, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> For whereas before, the right and clame to the Croune hong vpon an ordinarie and certaine courſe of the common lawe, vpon the certaine and aſſured right of the royall and vnſpotted blood, yea vpon the very lawe of nature, whereby many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, manie troubles, daungers and ſeditions are in al Countries politikely auoyded: ſo now depending vpon the ſtatute onely, it is as eaſie by an other ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to be infringed and ouerthrowen: and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon a Teſtament, it is ſubiect to many corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, ſiniſter dealinges, cauillations, yea and iuſt ouerthrowes, by the diſhabilitie of the Teſtatours

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption then of the Aduerſaries rather maketh for vs, and miniſtreth to vs good occaſion, to thinke, that the king would not haſard the weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch a matter, to reſte vpon the validitie or inualiditie of a bare Teſtament only.</p>
               <p>By this that we haue ſaid we may probably gather, that the King had no cauſe to aduenture ſo great an interpriſe by a bare will and Teſtament. Ye ſhall nowe heare alſo, why we thinke he did neuer attempt or enterpriſe any ſuch thing. It is well knowen, the King was not wonte lightly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlippe the occaſion of any great commoditie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently offered. And yet this notwithſtanding, hauing geuen to him by Acte of Parlament the ordering and diſpoſition of all Chantries and Colleges, he did neuer or very litle practiſe and execute this authoritie. And ſhall we thinke, vnleſſe full and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofe neceſſarily enforce creditte, that the King, to his no preſent commoditie and aduantage, but yet to his greate diſhonour, and to the greate obloquie of his ſubiectes and other Countries, to the notable diſheriſon of ſo may the next royall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8941:48"/>
blood, did vſe any ſuch authoritie, as is ſurmiſed?</p>
               <p>Againe, if he had made any ſuche aſsignation: who doubteth, but that as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditioned in the ſaid pretenſed will with his noble daughters,<note place="margin">In this ſuppoſed vvill is no condition for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the heires of the L. Francis, as is for the Kinges ovvne daughters.</note> to marie with his Counſels aduiſe, either els not to enioy the benefitte of the ſucceſsion: he would haue tyed the ſaid Ladie Francis and Ladie Eleonours heirs to the ſame condition.</p>
               <p>Further more, I am driuen to thinke, that there paſſed no ſuch limitation by the ſaid king Henries will, by reaſon there is not, nor was theſe many yeares any original copy therof, nor any authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Record in the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerie, or els where to be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in all England, as the Aduerſaries them ſelues confeſſe: And in the copies that be ſpread abrode, the witneſſes pretended to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the ſigning of the ſaid will, be ſuche, for the meaneſſe of their ſtate on the one ſide, &amp; for the greatneſſe &amp; weight of the cauſe on the other ſide, as ſeme not ſufficient in ſuche a caſe.</p>
               <p>The importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the cauſe, being no leſſe than the diſheriſon of ſo many heires of the Croune (as well from the one ſiſter, as from the other) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and craued ſome one or other of the priuie Caunſaile, or ſome one honorable and notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone to haue bene preſent at the ſaid ſigning: or that ſome notificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue bene made afterward to ſuche perſones by the King him ſelfe, or at leaſt before ſome Notarie and authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical perſon for the better ſtrengthening of the ſaid will.</p>
               <p>Here is now further to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that (ſeing the intereſt to the Croune is become a plaine teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie matter and clame, and dependeth vpon a laſt will) when, and before what Ordinarie this will was exhibited, allowed and prooued? VVhere, and of whome toke the Executours their othe for
<pb facs="tcp:8941:49"/>
the true performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the will?<note place="margin">No order taken for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the ſuppoſed vvill.</note> VVho committed to them the adminiſtration of the kings goods and chattles?

Namely vpon the ſignement of the kinges hand, wherein onely conſiſteth the weight of no leſſe, then of the Croune it ſelfe: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, or in what ſpiritual or temporal Courte may one find their depoſitions? But it were a very hard thing to finde that, that (as farre as men can learne) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was.</p>
               <p>And yet if the matter were ſo plaine, ſo good &amp; ſo ſound, as theſe men beare vs in hand: if the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Teſtement had ben ſuch, as might haue bidden the touchſtone, the triall, the light and the ſight of the worlde: why did not they, that enioyed moſt commoditie therby (and, for the ſway and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they bare, might and ought beſt to haue done it) take conuenient and ſure order, that the originall might haue bene duely and ſafely preſerued: or at leaſt, the ordinary Probate (which is in euery poore mans Teſtament diligently obſerued) might haue bene procured or ſene, by one or other authentical Inſtrument therof reſerued? The Aduerſaries them ſelues ſee wel enough, yea and are faine to confeſſe theſe defectes.<note place="margin">The enro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie is not a probate.</note> But to helpe this miſchief, they wold faine haue the Enrolment in the Chancerie to be taken for a ſufficient Probate, bycauſe (as they ſay) both the ſpiritual and temporall authoritie did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the kings perſon.</p>
               <p>Yet do they know wel inough, that this plaiſter will not cure the ſore, and that this is but a poore helpe and a ſhift. For neither the Letters Patents, nor the Enrolment may in any wiſe be counted a ſufficient Probate. The Chancerie is not the Court
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8941:49"/>
or ordinarie place for the probate of willes, nor the Rolles for recording the ſame. Both muſt be done in the Spiritual Courts: where the executours alſo muſt be impleaded, and geue their accompt: where the weakenes or ſtrengh of the will muſt be tried, the witneſſes examined, finally the probate, &amp; al other thinges thereto requiſite, diſpatched. Or if it may be done by any other perſone: yet muſt his authoritie be ſhewed. The probate and all thinges muſt be done accordinglye. And amonge other things the vſual clauſe of <hi>Saluo iure cuiuſcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>que,</hi> muſt not be omitted. VVhiche things, I am aſſured, the recording in the Chancerie cannot import.</p>
               <p>But this caution and prouiſo of <hi>Saluo iure cuiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque</hi> (whiche is moſt conformable to all law and reaſon) did litle ſerue ſome mens turne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was one other caution and prouiſo: that though the pooreſt mans Teſtament in all England hath this prouiſo at the probate of the ſame: yet for this Teſtament, the weightieſt, I trow, that euer was made in England, no ſuche probate or clauſe can be found, either in the one, or the other Court. Yet we nedes muſt, al this notwithſtanding, be borne in hande, and borne doune, that there was a Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; will, formably framed, according to the purpoſe and effect of the ſtatute: yet muſt the right of the imperiall Croune of England be conueied and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the colour &amp; ſhadow only of a will. I ſay, the ſhadow only, by reaſon of an other conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and preſumption, whiche I ſhall tel you of. VVhiche is ſo liuely and effectual, that I verily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it will be very harde for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by any good and probable reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to anſwere &amp; auoide the ſame: And is ſo important and vehement, that this only might ſeeme, vtterly to deſtroie al the Aduerſaries coniectural prooffes, concerning the maintenance
<pb facs="tcp:8941:50"/>
of this ſuppoſed will.</p>
               <p>VVe ſay therfore and affirme, that in caſe there had bene any good and ſure helpe and handfaſt, to take and hold the Croune for the heirs of Lady Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis by the ſaid will: that the faction, that vniuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded the Lady Iane, eldeſt daughter to the ſaid Lady Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis to the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Croune, would neuer haue omitted to take, receaue and imbrace the occaſion and benefit therof to them preſently offered.

One other, the ſaid VVilliam Clarke is ſo gone from them, that he geueth good cauſe, to miſdeeme and miſtruſt the whole matter. Howe many of the reſidue liue, I know not. To whom perchaunce ſome thing might be ſaid, if we once knowe, what them ſelues ſay. VVhich ſeeing it doth not by authenticall recorde appeare, bare names of dumme witneſſes can in no wiſe hinder &amp; deface ſo ſolemne a teſtimonie of the foreſaid L. Paget and Sir Edwarde Mountague.

It appeareth nowe then by the premiſſes:<note place="margin">Gloſſ. &amp; Doct. c. bona de elect.</note> that the Aduerſaries argumentes, whereby they would weaken and diſcredit the teſtimonie, either of the witneſſes, or of the executours, that haue or may come in againſt the ſaid pretenſed will, are but of ſmal force and ſtrength. And eſpecially their ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der exaggeration by a ſuperficial Rhetorike enforced. VVhereby they would abuſe the ignorance of the people, and make them beleue, that there was no good and ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tial prooffe brought foorth againſt the forgerie of this ſuppoſed will, bycauſe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth of the ſame was not preached at Poules Croſſe, and declared in al open places and aſſembles through the Realm: when they knowe wel inough, that there was no neceſsitie ſo to doe. And that it was notoriouſly knowen, by reaſon it was diſcloſed by the ſaide Lorde Paget, as wel to the Counſaile, as to the higher and lower houſe of the Parliament. And the foreſaid forged Recorde in the Chancerie therevpon worthely defaced, and aboliſhed. The
<pb facs="tcp:8941:53"/>
diſcloſing whereof, ſeing it came foorth by ſuch, &amp; in ſuch ſort &amp; order, as we haue ſpecified: as it doth nothing deface or blemiſh the teſtimonie geuen againſt the ſaid ſuppoſed will, whether it were of any of the witneſſes, or executours: ſo is ther no nede at all, why any other witneſſes, byſides thoſe that haue already impugned the ſame, ſhould be now farther producted.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratrie and reuoke this his ſolemne depoſition, it ought not lightly to be diſcredited for any ſuche contradiction afterward happening.

               <p>VVhereas they would nowe inferre, that either this pretenſed will was King Henries will, or that he made none at all: I doo not (as I haue ſaid) enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, nor neede not curiouſly to examine and diſcuſſe this thing, as a matter not apperteining to our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8941:53"/>
purpoſe. And well it may be, that he made a will conteining the whole tenour of this pretenſed will (ſauing for the limitation of the Croune) and that theſe ſuppoſed witneſſes were preſent, either when he ſubſcribed the ſame with his own hand, or when by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement the Stampe (of which and of his owne hand, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort of men make no difference, as in dede in diuers other caſes there is no difference, whiche theſe witneſſes might take to be as it were his owne hand) was ſet to the wil.</p>
               <p>This, I ſay, might after ſome ſort ſo be. And yet this notwithſtanding there might be (as there was in deede) an other will touching the pretenſed limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Croune by the Kinges owne hande counterfeyted and ſuborned after his death falſly and colourably, bearing the countenance of his owne hand, and of the pretenſed wittneſſes names. How ſo euer it be, it is but to ſmal purpoſe, to goe about any full and exquiſite anſwere touching this point, ſeeing that neither the original ſurmiſed wil, whereof theſe witneſſes are ſuppoſed to be priuy is extant: nor their depoſitions any where appeare: nor yet that it appeareth, that euer they were (as we haue ſaid) iudicially examined.</p>
               <p>Seeing nowe then, that if it ſo falleth out, that the principal will, and that whiche was by the great Seale exemplified, and in the Chancery recorded, had not (at leaſt touching the clauſe of limitation &amp; aſsignement of the Croune) the Kings hand to it: we neede not, nor wil not tarie about certain ſcrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and copies of the ſaid will, that the Aduerſaries prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to haue ben either writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſigned with his hand. A kingdom is to heauy to be ſo eaſely caried away by ſuche ſcrolles and copies. VVhen all this faileth, the Aduerſaries haue yet one ſhift left for the laſt caſt. They vrge the equitie of the matter and
<pb facs="tcp:8941:54"/>
the mind of the Parlament. VVhich is, they ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and ſatisfied, by making this aſsignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the eſtabliſhing of the ſucceſsion, &amp; prouiding, that the Realme ſhould not be left void of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour. And therefore we muſt not ſubuert the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, in cauilling for the defect of the Kings hand: foraſmuch as the Parlament might haue had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed his conſent onely, without any hand writing. VVhiche as I doe not denie, ſo in theſe great affaires and ſo ample a commiſsion, in ſuche abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie geuen to him, it was prouidently and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily foreſene, to binde the Acte to the Kings owne hand, for auoyding al ſiniſter &amp; euill dealing, the whiche the Aduerſaries would haue vs in no caſe to miſdoubt or miſtruſt in this will. VVhereas the notoriouſnes of the fact, &amp; the lamentable eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of things do openly declare the ſame, and pitifully crieth out againſt it.</p>
               <p>Neither wil we graunt to them, that the minde and purpoſe of the Parlament is ſatiſfied, for ſuch cauſes, as we haue and ſhall hereafter more largely declare. And if it were otherwiſe true: yet doth this only defect of the Kinges hand breake &amp; infringe the whole Acte.<note place="margin">VVhy the ſtampe can not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile the Kinges hand in this caſe.</note> For this is a ſtatute correctorie, and derogatorie to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> courſe of the lawe, as cutting away the ſucceſsion of the lawfull &amp; true inheritours. It is alſo, as appeareth by the tenour of the ſame, a moſt greuouſe penal lawe, and therfore we may not ſhift or alter the wordes of the lawe, Neither may we ſupply the manner and doing of the acte preſcribed, by any other act equiualent. So that albeit in ſome other thing the Stampe or the Kinges certaine &amp; knowen conſente may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiſe his hande: yet, as the caſe ſtandeth here, it will not ſerue the turne, by reaſon there is a preciſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and forme preſcribed &amp; appointed.

might multiplie in the prooff of this matter wherein we haue taried the longer, bycauſe the Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries make ſo great a countenance therevpon: and bycauſe all vnder one, it may ſerue for the anſwere alſo touching the Kinges royal aſſente to be geuen to Parlamentes by his Letters Patentes ſigned with his hande: which is nothing elſe but a declaration &amp; affirmance of the common lawe, &amp; no newe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie geuen to him, to do that he could not doo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or any forme preſcribed to bind him vnto. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, in this caſe there is no feare in the worlde of forging and counterfeyting the Kinges hande: whereas in the Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie cauſe it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as the worlde knoweth, and dayly experience teacheth. And ſo withall do we conclude, that by reaſon this ſurmiſed will was not ſigned with the Kinges hand: it can not any way hurt or hinder the iuſte right and clame of the Queene of Scotland, to the ſucceſsion of the Croune of England.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſing, that neither the L. Paget, nor Sir Edward Montague, and VVilliam Clarke had teſtified or plubliſhed any thing to the infringing &amp; ouerthrowing of the Aduerſaries aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, touching the ſigning of the ſaid will: yet is not therby the Queene of Scotlandes title altogether hindred. For ſhe yet hath her iuſt and lawful defence for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning of the ſaid aſſertion, as well againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones and ſayings of the witneſſes, if any ſhall come foorth, as otherwiſe ſhee may iuſtly require the ſaid wil to be brought forth to light, and eſpecially the ſigning of the ſame with the Kings hande, to be duely and conſideratly pondered, weyghed and conferred. She hath her iuſt defence and exeptions and muſt haue. And it were againſt al lawes, and the lawe of nature it ſelfe, to ſpoile her of the ſame. And all good reaſon geueth, that the ſaid original will
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8941:56"/>
ſtanding vpon the triall of the Kings hande, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited: that it may be compared with his other certaine and well knowen hand writing. And that other things may be done that are requiſite in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>But yet all this notwithſtanding, let vs nowe imagine &amp; ſuppoſe, that the King him ſelfe, whoſe hart and hand were doubtleſſe farre from any ſuch doings: lette vs yet, I ſay, admitte, that he had ſigned the ſaid will with his owne hande. Yet for all that, the Aduerſaries perchance ſhal not finde, no not in this caſe, that the Queenes iuſte Title, right and intereſt doth any thing fayle or quayle.<note place="margin">The ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vvill can not preiudice the Quene of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, though it had ben ſigned vvi h the Kinges ovv e hand.</note> Or rather lette vs without any perchance ſay, the iuſtice and equitie of her cauſe, and the inuincible force of trueth to be ſuche, that neither the Stampe, nor the Kinges owne hande can beare and beate it downe. VVhiche thing we ſpeake not without good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and weightie reaſons.</p>
               <p>Neither do we at this time minde, to debate &amp; diſcourſe, what power and autoritie, and how farre the Parlament hath to doe, in this and like caſes. VVhiche perchance ſome other would here do. VVe will only intermedle with other thinges, that reache not ſo farre, nor ſo high, and ſeeme in this our preſent queſtion worthy and neceſſarie to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>And firſt, before we enter into other matters, we aſke this reaſonable and neceſſarie queſtion, whether theſe general words, wherby this large &amp; ample authoritie is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied to king Henry, muſt be as generally, and as amply taken, or be reſtrained by ſome manner of limitation and reſtriction agreable to ſuch mind and purpoſe of the Parlament, as muſt of very neceſsitie or great likelihod be conſtrued, to be the very mind and purpoſe of the ſaid Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:8941:57"/>
Ye wil ſay perchance, that the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of aſsignation muſt be taken generally and abſolutely, without exception, ſauing for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigning of the wil. Trueth it is, there is nothing els expreſſed: but yet was there ſome thinges els principally intended, and yet for all that, needed not to be ſpecified.</p>
               <p>The outward manner was ſo ſpecially and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely appointed and ſpecified, to auoyde ſuſpitious dealing, to auoide corruption and forgery. And yet was the will good and effectual, without the Kinges hande.<note place="margin">Ther muſt needes be ſome qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the general vvordes of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</note> Yea and the aſsignation to had ben good, had not that reſtrainte of the Kinges hande bene added by the Parlament. But for the qualification of the perſon to be limited and aſsigned, and ſo for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie reſtriction and limitation of the wordes, were they neuer ſo large &amp; ample: there is (though nothing were ſpoken thereof) an ordinary helpe &amp; remedie. Otherwiſe, if the Realme had ben ſet ouer to a furious or a madde man, or to an idiote, or to ſome foraine and Mahometical Prince (and to ſuch a one as ſtories teſtifie that King Iohn would haue ſubmitted him ſelfe &amp; his Realme) or to any other notorious incapable or vnhable perſon:<note place="margin">Matthaeus Pariſieuſis in Iohan.</note> the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of the wordes ſeeme to beare it, but the good minde and purpoſe of the Parlament, and mans reaſon doe in no wiſe beare it. If ye graunt, that theſe wordes muſt nedes haue ſome good and honeſt conſtruction and interpretation, as reaſon doth force you to graunt it: yet will I aſke further, whether as the King cutte of in this pretenſed will the whole noble race of the eldeſt ſiſter, and the firſt iſſue of the yongeſt ſiſter: ſo if he had cutte of alſo al the ofſpringes as wel of the ſaid yongeſt ſiſter, as of the remnante of the royal blood, &amp; placed ſome, being not of the ſaid blood, &amp; percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce otherwiſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8941:57"/>
vnable: this aſsignation had bene good and vailable in lawe, as conformable to reaſon, and to the mind and purpoſe of the Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? It were ſurely to great an abſurdity, to graunt it.</p>
               <p>There muſt be therefore in this matter ſome reaſonable moderation and interpretation, as wel touching the perſones comprehended within this aſsignation, &amp; their qualities, &amp; for the perſons alſo hauing right, &amp; yet excluded, as for the manner of the doing of the act, &amp; ſigning the wil. For the king as King, could not diſpoſe the Croune by his will: &amp; was in this behalfe but an Arbiter and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. VVherefore his doinges muſt be directed and ruled by the lawe, &amp; according to the good minde and meaning of thoſe, that gaue the authoritie. And what their minde was, it will appeare well enough, euen in the ſtatute it ſelfe. It was for the auoiding of all ambiguities, doubtes and diuiſions, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Succeſsion. They putte their whole truſt vpon the King, as one, whome they thought moſt earneſtly to minde the wealth of the Realme: as one that would, and could beſt and moſt prudently conſider and weigh the matter of the Succeſsion, and prouide for the ſame accordingly.</p>

But that there is good and great cauſe further to conſider and debate vpon it, whether it be ſo, or no: let the indifferent, when they haue wel thought vpon it, iudge accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Aduerſaries them ſelues can not altogether denie, but that this Teſtament is not correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſuch expectation, as men worthely ſhould haue of it. VVhiche thing they do plainly confeſſe. For in vrging their preſumptions, whereof we haue ſpoken and minding to proue, that this wil, whiche they ſay is commonly called King Henries VVill, was no new VVil deuiſed in his ſicknes but euen the very ſame, wherof (as they ſay) were diuers olde copies: they inferre theſe wordes, ſaying thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if it be a nevve vvill then deuiſed, vvho could thinke, that either h m ſelfe vvould, or any man durſt haue moued him, to put therin ſo many thinges contrary to his honour? Much leſſe durſt they them ſelues deuiſe any nevv ſucceſsion, or moue him to alter it, othervviſe then they found it, vvhen they ſavv, that naturally it could not be othervviſe diſpoſed.</hi> VVherein they ſay very truely. For it is certaine, that not only the common lawe of that Realm, but nature it ſelfe telleth vs, that the Queene of Scotland (after the ſaid Kinges chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) is the next and rightful Heire of the Croune. VVherefore the King, if he had excluded her, he had done an vnnatural act Ye will ſay, he had ſome cauſe to doo this, by reaſon ſhe was a forainer, and borne out of the Realme. Yet this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he did very vnnaturally, yea vnaduiſedly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideratly and wrongfully, and to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice and danger of his owne Title to the Croune of France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we haue already declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:8941:58"/>And moreouer it is well to be weighed, that reaſon, and equitie, and <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> doth require &amp; craue, that as the kings of that Realm would thinke them ſelues to be iniuriouſly handled and openly wronged, if they mariyng with the heires of Spaine, Scotland, or any other Countrey (where the ſuceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Croune deuolueth to the woman) were ſhutte out, and barred from their ſaid right due to them by the wiues (as we haue ſaid:) ſo likewiſe they ought to think of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their royal blood, that marie in Scotland, that they may wel iudge and take them ſelues muche iniuried, vnnaturally and wrongfully dealt withall, to be thruſte from the ſucceſsion of that Croune, being thereto called by the nexte proximitie of the royal blood. And ſuch deuolutions of other Kingdoms to the Croune of England by foraine mariage, might by poſsibilitie often times haue chaunced, and was euen nowe in this our time very like to haue chanced for Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, if the intended mariage with the Queene of Scotland that nowe is, and the late King Edward the ſixt with his longer life, &amp; ſome iſſue had taken place.</p>
               <p>But now, that ſhe is no ſuche forainer, as is not capable of the Croune, we haue at large already diſcuſſed. Yea I will now ſay farther, that ſuppoſing the Parlament minded to exclude her, and might rightfuly ſo doe, and that the King by vertue of this ſtatute did exclude her in his ſuppoſed will: yet is ſhe not a plaine forainer, and incapable of the Croune. For if the lawfull heires of the ſaid Ladie Francis, and of the Ladie Eleonour ſhould happen to faile (whiche ſeeme now to faile, at the leaſt in the Ladie Katherin and her iſſue, for whoſe title, great ſturre hath lately ben made, by reaſon of a late ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce definitiue, geuen againſt her pretenſed
<pb facs="tcp:8941:59"/>
mariage with the Earle of Herford) then is there no ſtay or ſtoppe, either by the Parlament, or by the ſuppoſed VVill, but that ſhe the ſaid Quene of Scotlande, and her Heires, may haue and obteine their iuſt Title and clame. For by the ſaid pretenſed will it is limited, that for default of the lawfull Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the ſaid Ladie Francis &amp; Elenour, the Croune ſhall remaine and come to the next rightful Heires.</p>
               <p>But if ſhe ſhall be ſaid to be a forainer for the time, for the induction of farther argument: then what ſaye the Aduerſaries to the Ladie Leneux, borne at Herbottel in England, and from thirtene yeares of age brought vppe alſo in England, and commonly taken and reputed as well of the King and Nobilitie, as of other, the lawefull Neece of the ſaid king? Yea to turn now to the other ſiſter of the King maried to Charles Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don Duke of Suffolke, and her children, the Ladie Francis, and the Ladie Eleonour: why are they alſo diſherited? Surely, if there be no iuſt cauſe, neither in the Lady Leneux, nor in the other: it ſeemeth the King hath made a plaine Donatiue of the Croune. VVhiche thinge whether he could doe, or whether it be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the expectation of the Parlament, or for the Kinges honour, or for the honour of the Realme, I leaue it to the further conſideration of other.</p>
               <p>Nowe, what cauſes ſhould moue the Kinge, to ſhutte them out by his pretenſed will from the Title of the Croune: I minde not, nor neede not (eſpecially ſeeing I take no notice of any ſuche will, touching the limitation of the ſaid Croune) here to proſecute or examine.</p>
               <p>Yet am I not ignorant, what impedimentes many doo talke of, and ſome as well by printed, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed Bookes, doe writte of. VVherein I will not take vpon me any aſſeueration, any reſolution or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8941:59"/>
iudgement.</p>
               <p>This onely will I propound, as it were by the way of conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, duely &amp; depely to be wayghed and thought vpon: that is, for as muche as the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte of this ſurmiſed will tendeth to the extruſion of the Queene of Scotland, and others altogether, and to the iſſue of the French Queene: whether in caſe the King had no cauſe to be offended with his ſiſters the Frenche Queenes Children (as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries them ſelues confeſſe he had not, and that there was no lawfull impediment in them, to take the ſucceſsion of the Croune) it were any thing reaſonable, or euer was once meant of the Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the King without cauſe ſhould diſherite and exclude them from the title of the Croune. On the other ſide, if ther were any ſuch impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this ſurmiſed will geueth out a great ſuſpicion) it is to be conſidered, whether it ſtandeth with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and iuſtice, with the honour of the king, and the whole Realme, or with the minde, purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente of the ſaid Parlament, that the King ſhould not onely fruſtrate and exclude ſuche, whoſe right by the common lawe is moſte euidente and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe, but call and ſubſtitute ſuche other,<note place="margin">L. ſi pater. ff.

               <p>Firſt, that who ſoeuer geueth any man a generall authoritie, to do any thing, ſeemeth not to geue him authoritie, to do that thing, whiche he would not haue graunted, if his minde therein had bene ſeuerally and ſpecially aſked and required. Againe, generall wordes either of the Teſtatours, or of ſuch as make any contract, &amp; eſpecially of ſtatutes, touching any perſons, to doe or enioy any thing, ought to be reſtrained and referred to hable, mete,
<pb facs="tcp:8941:60"/>
and capable perſons onely.</p>
               <p>It is furthermore a rule and a Principle, that ſtatutes muſt be ruled, meaſured and interpreted, according to the minde and direction of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and common lawe. VVherefore the King in limiting the ſucceſsion of the Croune in this ſorte, as is pretended, ſeemeth not to anſwere and ſatisfie the expectation of the Parlament: putting the caſe there were any ſuche ſurmiſed impediment, as alſo on the other ſide likewiſe, if there were no ſuche ſuppoſed impediment.</p>
               <p>For here an other rule muſt be regarded: which is, that in Teſtaments, Contractes, and namely in ſtatutes, the generalitie of wordes muſt be gently and ciuily moderated, and meaſured by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawe, and reſtrained, when ſo euer any man ſhould by that generalitie take any dammage and hurte vndeſeruedly. Yea, the Statute ſhall rather in that caſſe ceaſſe and quaile, and be taken as void. As for example, it appe eth by the Ciuill lawe, that if it be enacted by ſtatute in ſome Cities, that noman ſhall pleade againſt an Inſtrument, no not the Executour: yet this notwithſtanding, if the Executour make a true and perfect Inuentorie of the goodes of the Teſtatour, if he deale faithfully and truely, rather than he ſhould wrongfully and without cauſe paie the Teſtatours debt of his owne, he may come and pleade againſt the Inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. VVherefore the kings doings ſeeme either muche defectiue in the ſaid Ladie Francis, &amp; Ladie Elenour, or much exceſsiue in their children. And ſo though he had ſigned the ſaid will with his hand: yet the ſaid doings ſeme not conformable to the mind and purpoſe of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament.</p>
               <p>VVe will now go forward, and propound other great and graue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations ſeruing our ſaid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8941:60"/>
and intent. VVhereof one is that in limiting the Croune vnto the heires of the bodie of the Lady Francis, the ſame Ladie then, and ſo long after liuing, the ſaid King did not appoint the Succeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Croune, according to the order &amp; meaning of he honorable Parlament: foraſmuch as the ſaid Acte of Parlament gaue to him authoritie, to limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and appoint the Croune to ſuch perſone, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones in reuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or remainder, as ſhould pleaſe his Highnes. Meaning thereby ſome perſone certaine, of whome the people might haue certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg &amp; vnderſtanding, after the death of king Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the eight. VVhich perſones certaine the heires of the Ladie Francis could not by any meanes be intended:<note place="margin">11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fo</hi> 72. 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6 <hi>fo.</hi> 24. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 15.</note> foraſmuch as the ſaid Ladie Francis was then liuing, and therfore could then haue no heires at al. By reaſon whereof the people of that Realme could not haue cettaine knowledge and perfit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Succeſsion, according to the true meaning &amp; intent of the ſaid Acte of parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
               <p>But to this matter ſome peraduenture would ſeeme to anſwere and ſay, that although at the time of the ſaid King Henries death, the Heires of the bodie of the ſaid Ladie Francis begotten, were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine: yet at ſuche time, as the ſaid remainder ſhould happen to fal, the ſaid heires might then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be knowen. In deede I will not deny, but that peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture they might be then certainly knowen. But what great miſchieffes and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces might haue enſued, and yet may, if the wil take place vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that peraduenture &amp; vncertaine limitation: I would wiſhe all men well to note and conſider.</p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted, but that it might haue fortuned, at ſuch time as the remainder ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall to the ſaid heires of the Ladie Francis, the ſame Ladye Francis ſhould then be alſo liuing:
<pb facs="tcp:8941:61"/>
who, I pray you, then ſhould haue had the Croune? Paraduenture ye wold ſay, the heires of the body of the Ladie Eleonour, to whome the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder was appointed. Vndoubtedlye that were contrarie to the meanyng of the ſayde ſuppoſed will: forſomuch as the remainder is therby limited vnto the heires of the body of the Ladie Eleonour onely for default of iſſue of the Ladie Francis. VVherby it may be very plainly gathered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid ſuppoſed wil, that the meaning therof was not, that the children of the Lady Eleonour ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye the Croune, before the children of the Lady Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis. But what if the ſaid Lady Eleonour had bene then alſo liuing (which might haue happened, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmuch as both the ſaid Ladie Francis and Ladie Eleonour, by common courſe of nature, might haue liued longer, then vntil this day) who then ſhould haue had the Croune? Truly the right Heire (whome this ſuppoſed will meante to exclude) ſo long as there ſhould remaine any iſſue, either of the body of the ſaid Ladie Francis, or of the bodie of the ſaid Ladie Eleonour lawfully begotten. And therefore quite contrarie to the meaning of the ſaid ſuppoſed will, wherefore I doe verely thinke, that it would hardly ſinke into any reaſonable mans head, that had any experience of the great wiſdome and aduiſed doings of King Henry the eight about other matters being of nothing like weight, that he would ſo ſlenderly and ſo vnaduiſedly diſpoſe the ſucceſsione of the Croune (wherevpon the whole eſtate of that Realme doth depend) in ſuche wiſe, that they, to whome he meant to geue the ſame by his wil, could not enioye it by the lawe. VVherevpon ye may plainely ſee, not onely the great vnlikelihod, that King Henry the eight would make, any ſuch wil with ſuch ſlender aduiſe,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8941:61"/>
but alſo, that by the limitation of the ſaid will, the ſuccceſſion of the Croune is made more vncertaine and doubtfull, then it was before the making of the ſaid Actes of Parlament. VVhich is contrary to the meaning and intent of the ſaid Actes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any ſufficient warrant in law.</p>
               <p>But peraduenture ſome here will ſay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe daungers &amp; vncertainties might haue enſewed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the limitation of the ſaid wil: yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they haue not happened, neither be like to happen, they are therefore not to be ſpoken of. Ye as verely, it was not to be omitted. For although theſe things haue not happened, and therefore the more tolerable: yet for as much as they might haue happened, by the limitation of the ſaid ſuppoſed will, contrary to the meaning of the ſaid Actes, the will can not by any meanes be ſaid to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning and intent of the makers of the ſaid ſtatutes. And therefore in that reſpect the ſaid will is inſufficient in lawe. And to aggrauate the matter farther, ye ſhall vnderſtand of great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences and imminent daungers, which as yet are likely to enſue, if that ſuppoſed will ſhould take place.</p>
               <p>It is not vnknowen, but that at the time of the making of the ſaid will, the ſaid Lady Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis had no iſſue male, but onely three daughters betwene her, &amp; Henrie Duke of Suffolke. Afterward in the time of the late ſoueraigne Lady Queene Marie, the ſaid Duke of Suffolke was attainted, and ſuffered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. After whoſe death the ſaid Ladie Francis, to her great diſhonour and abaſing of her ſelfe, toke to huſbande one Adrian Stokes, who was before her ſeruant, a man of very meane eſtate and voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had iſſue by him. VVhiche iſſue (if it were a ſonne, &amp; be alſo yet liuing) by the wordes of the
<pb facs="tcp:8941:62"/>
ſaid ſuppoſed will, is to inherite the Croune of that Realme, before the daughters betwene her and the ſaid late Duke of Suffolke begotten, whiche thing was neither intended, nor meant by the makers of the ſaid Actes. VVho can with any reaſon or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſenſe thinke, that al the ſtates of the Realme aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together at the ſaid Parlament, did meane, to geue authoritie to King Henry the eight, by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents or laſt will to diſherit the Queene of Scotland linially deſcended of the blood royal of that Realme, and to appoint the ſonne of Adrian Stokes, then a meane ſeruing man of the Duke of Suffolks, to be King &amp; Gouernour ouer that noble Realme of England. The inconueniences whereof, as alſo of the like that might haue followed of the pretenſed Mariage of M. Keies the late Sergeante Porter, I referre to the graue conſiderations and iudgementes of the honorable and worſhipfull of that Realme.</p>
               <p>Some peraduenture will ſay, that King Henry the eight meant by his will, to diſpoſe the Croune vnto the Heires of the body of the ſaid Ladie Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis by the ſaid Duke lawfully begotten, &amp; not vnto the heires by any other perſon to be begotten. VVhich meaning although it might very hardly be gathered vpon the ſaid ſuppoſed will: yet can not the ſame be without as great inconueniences, as the other. For if the Croune ſhould now remaine vnto the heires of the bodie of the ſaid Ladie Francis by the ſaid Duke begotten then ſhould it remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two daughters ioyntly, they both being termed and certainly accompted in law but one heire. And by that meanes the ſtate and gouernment of that Realme ſhould be changed from the auncient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, into the gouernement of many. For the Title of the Ladie Francis being by way of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8941:62"/>
whiche is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted in law a ioynt purchaſe, doth make all the iſſue female inheritable a like, and can not go according to the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t law of a deſcent to the Croune: which is, that the Croune by deſcent muſt go to the eldeſt daughter only, as is aforeſaid. For great differences be in law, where one cometh to any Title by deſcent, and where, as a purchaſſor. And alſo if the one of thoſe iſſues female dye, then were her heire in the Title, as a ſeueral tenant in tayle. And ſo there ſhould follow, that ſo many daughters, ſo many general Gouernors, &amp; ſo might their iſſue, being heirs femals, make the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grow infinite. VVhich thing was moſt farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meaning of the makers of that Acte of Parlament.</p>
               <p>VVhat if the ſaid King had by his laſt will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed that realme into two or three parts, diuiding the gouernement thereof to three perſons, to rule as ſeueral Kinges: as for example, wales vnto one, the Northe partes vnto an other, the South partes vnto the third, and by that meanes had miſerably rent that Realme into partes? Had this bene accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the entent and meaning of the ſaid Acte of Parlament? Or had it bene a good and ſufficient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation in law? No verily, I thinke no man of any reaſonable vnderſtanding wil ſo ſay. And no more can he either ſay, or thinke of the remainder limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the heires of the body of the ſaid Lady Francis by the ſaid ſuppoſed will.</p>
               <p>Now to complete and finiſh this our Treatiſe touching the Queene of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds Title to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Croune: as we haue done, ſo let vs freely and liberally graunt the Aduerſaries that, whiche is not true, that is, that the ſaid ſuppoſed wil was ſigned with the kings own hand. Let the heires of the Lady Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis come forth in Gods name, &amp; lay forth to the world their demaund &amp; ſuppoſed right
<pb facs="tcp:8941:63"/>
againſt the ſaid Q. of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds intereſt. The Queene on the other ſide, to fortifie &amp; ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ghten her clame, layeth foorth to the open ſight of all the worlde her iuſt title and intereſt, ſigned, and alwaies a fore this time allowed, not onely as with the Seales, but with the othes alſo of al the kings, that euer were in England, taken at the time of their Coronation, for the continuance of the lawes of that noble Realme of England, ſigned and allowed, I ſay, almoſt of all the world by ſides: yea ſigned with God and natures owne fingers. Her right is as open, and as clere, as the bright Sonne. Now, to darken and ſhadow this glorious light: what doe the heires of the ſaid Ladie Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis, or others bringe foorth, to ground their iuſt clame and demaund vpon? VVhen all is done, they are faine to runne and catche hold vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> king Henry the eightes written will, ſigned with his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. VVel, let them take as good handfaſt thereon, as they can: but yet lette them ſhewe the ſaid Queene the ſaid original will. It is well knowen, that they themſelues haue ſaid, that that to doe they can not: Yet let them at leaſt lay forth ſome authentical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the ſame. It is alſo notorious, that they can not. If then the foundation of their clame, being the will of ſuch a Prince, &amp; of ſo late and freſh memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie made, neither the original, nor yet any good and woorthy Recorde ſufficiently authoriſed, remaine of the ſame: by what colour will they exclude the ſaide Queene? They muſt clame either by proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of blood, or by Charter. For the firſt, nature hath excluded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Charter thei haue none to ſhew.</p>
               <p>They wil perchaunce crie out, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain of the loſſe and imbeaſeling of the ſame, and ſay, that ſuch a caſualtie ſhould not deſtroye and extinguiſh their right. This were ſome thing perchaunce, if it were in a priuate mans caſe. It were ſomewhat, if their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8941:63"/>
demaund did not deſtroy the common law, and the lawe of nature alſo. It were ſomewhat, if their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Charter were periſhed, or by any fraudulent meanes intercepted by the ſaid Queene. Vpon whome, in this point, it is not poſsible to faſten any the very leaſt ſiniſter ſuſpicion. It were ſomewhat, if they did not aſpire to take gaine and lucre, or if the Queene ſought not to auoide dammage. For dammage it is, when any perſon is ſpoiled of any right due to him by lawe and reaſon. And there is a great oddes in the conſideration of the lawe and reaſon, betwene aduancing our gaine (&amp; gaine wee do that, that doth grow &amp; accrew vnto vs by more gifte or legacie, as doth the Croune,<note place="margin">Non eſt par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F VVE VVELL REMEMBER the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold hurtes, and olde calamities of this our Ylande Britaine: we ſhall finde that nothing therein hathe brought foorthe more harmes than hathe diſcorde: And on the other ſide, all auncient hiſtories teſtifie that by concorde Cities haue bene builded: many warres extincte, and moſt inuiolable frendeſhippes eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſhed. For ſuche is the force of Concorde, as all thinges in the worlde therby doe (as it were) ioyne handes to gether with loue and lykinge amonge them ſelues. Concorde dyd aſſociate mankynd togither, whiche before were diſperſed and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: So dyd ſhe teache them to vſe fidelitie one to an other, and to lyue vnder a forme of policie and Gouernement.

and auoyd all mutuall ſtryfe &amp; contention. Lyke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was made to Scipio ſurnamed Aphricanꝰ: who, hauing by many conflictes daunted the Numanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and broken their great forces, aſked of Tyreſius Prince of the Celtanes, how it happened that Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia whiche ſo long tyme before had bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible, was at the laſt ouerthrowen bycauſe (ſayd Tyreſius) the amitye and concorde of the Citizens before made them victorious, and nowe their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorde hath brought their deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as there is nothing ſo weake, &amp; ſlender, whiche by concorde may not be ſtrengthened: ſo nothing is ſo ſtrong, but diſcorde can ouerturne it. And it is manifeſtlye knowne what famouſe common welthes haue bene defaced and ruyned by diſcorde and ſedition: and that no Empire is ſo wel fortified, no Citie ſo ſurely eſtabliſhed, nor houſe ſo firmelye builded, but that by hatred and diſſention it may be ouerturned, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in pieces, diſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, and deſtroyed For diſcord (as Liuie ſayeth) maketh two Cities of one.

            <p>Now therfore when I deeply conſider with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8941:66"/>
how many and howe greate benefites and ſingular guiftes allmightie God hathe endewed your Yland Britaine aboue many other Countries: I can not but greatly meruaile, what ſhould be the cauſe whie you are not more carefull to confirme a perpetuall peace and amitie among your ſelues. For you want but this one thinge to make you ſeeme the moſt happie people in the worlde. This Yland is ſo full fraught with all thinges neceſſarie to mannes vſe, as nothing is there wanting, whiche a man may well wiſhe for. Firſt, it is furniſhed with great ſtore of all thinges nedefull, eyther for mannes profit, or for his pleaſure: in ſo much as not only it hath no need of helpe of other Countries, but it is alſo able to ſupplie the wantes, and to ſerue the turne of forrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And all this fertilitie and welthe (as in a ſtrong Yland enuironed euery waye by ſea) is ſufficiently fenced and fortified, by the naturall ſituation, from all foraine incurſions &amp; inrodes. Byſyde all this, the commoditie of ſoyle and eyr (be it ſpoken without offence of other nations) bringeth foorth menne and women, eyther in reſpect of comelyneſſe of perſonage, ſtrengthe of bodye, or excellencie of witt, ſo perfect, as elſe where in any place are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be found. Britaine therfore may well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted an Yland framed by nature and faſhioned not only to defend itſelfe, but alſo to beare a great ſwaye in the worlde: And not without cauſe: for the Yle Crete was (in auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mennes opinion) eſtemed to be conueniently ſituated to get and gayne the Empire of Grece, by cauſe it was euery waye enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſea, being not farre diſtant from Peloponeſe of one ſyde, &amp; very neare to Triopio, on an other ſide. And by that oportunitie Minos King of Crete became Lord and Soueraign of thoſe ſeas: inuaded the yles adioyning: placed in them new inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,
<pb facs="tcp:8941:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and if he had not dyed (as Ariſtotle ſaithe) when he went about to conquerre Sicilia: he was lyke to haue greatly enlarged the kyndome and dominions of Crete. But in how many degrees doeth your Yle excell Crete? It is not to be doubted, but that your aunceſtors had achiued famouſe interpriſes, with great honour, if their naturall helpes, and valiant attemptes had not bene fruſtrated by their Ciuile diſſentions.</p>
            <p>VVell, reaſon perſuadeth me that a ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all your diſſentions procedeth from the multitude of Gouernours, and from diuerſitie of opinions, and parties among the communaltye: for the regiment of many is verie muche ſubiecte to ſtryfe and diſſention. Therfore Ariſtotle, regarding that conſonant &amp; vniforme agrement of all thinges whiche appeareth in the whole frame of the world, ſettyth downe this, for a concluſion, <hi>the vvorld vvas made by one God.</hi> And Homere poetically imagining that there were many Goddes contendyng among them ſelues about the wellfare, and wrecke of Troye, whiles ſome were of opinion to deſtroye the Citie, and ſome to ſaue it at laſt he breaketh out into this exclamation: <hi>The regiment of many is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, let one Gouerne.</hi> For where the ſtate is ſuche as many may beare the ſwaye: there oftentimes many controuerſies doe growe, and verie harde it is for a ſocietie to ſtand faſt and continue: bycauſe the more a man excedeth in haughtineſſe (or fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather) of mynde, leſſe able he is to endure a compere: according to that ſayeing of the Poet. <q>

In ſo much as their inordinate deſire to rule (whiche is the very ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and ſede plott of all warres) is by your Riches nouriſhed, and with your great trauailes, paines, and bloodeſhed foſtered and maynteyned. Oh miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people: Oh wreched &amp; infortunate ſtate, which neuer could brooke good fortune, neuer wolde be reformed by any neceſſitie, nor was bredde by good deſtinye, but by ſelfe will and blyndeneſſe allwayes ouerruled. Of trueth, it is mere madneſſe to preferre the luſt and gredyneſſe of a few Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannes before a mans ſelfe, and all that is his: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſafetye and lybertie of his Countrie: As they of <hi>Sychem</hi> dyd, whiche vpon the diſhoneſt motion of <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſubmitted them ſelues vnto his gouernement.<note place="margin">

The lyke wickedneſſe was in England com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by that miſcheuouſe parricide, the Tyranne Richard: who (to gain the kingdom) neither regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the honour of his brother, then lately deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: the lyues of his noble Countrie men: the blood of his nephewes, the right heires of the Croune: nor yet the Chaſtitie of their mother the Queene: ſo great and ſo impatient deſire to rule and Raigne
<pb facs="tcp:8941:68"/>
caried awaye the cruell mynde of an outragiouſe Tyranne.</p>
            <p>But I woote well that none of you at this day doe fauoure ſuch aſpirynge myndes &amp; ambitiouſe deſirers of Souereintye, except thoſe whiche ſeek their own priuate gayne, by the generall diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the whole Yle: and preferre the doctrine of Machiauel before the inſtitution of a Chriſtian. I hope therfore now that the olde reproche that was wont to be obiected againſt the Engliſh, wilbe quite forgotten. It is a common prouerbe (ſayth Polidor) that Engliſh menne, by an olde cuſtome, haue leaſt regarde of all other nations to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthe of their own Countrie, euer inclined to factions, and by that meanes haue layed their countrie open to the ſpoyle and pray of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And this to haue hapned to that nation, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth vs. For in the begynnyng of that kyngdome (as Polidor in his firſt booke reporteth) when euery mightye manne ſought to be a kyng, great ciuil warres continued there ſo long, till at the laſt the whole Soueraingntie came into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of fyue Tyrannes. Therfore throughe domeſticall trouble and ſedition it was then a barbarous cruell age. For theſe, inflamed with ambition to rule, and incenſed with mutuall hatred among them ſelues, afflicted the inhabitantes of that countrey miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye. But at laſt when they had deſtroyed one an other, the whole gouernement of the common wealthe was referred to one of the ſame countrey, and by hym all thinges were reduced to vnitie: and after long warres, peace was eſtabliſhed. Cornelius Tacitus making mention of the factions of thoſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ſayeth, that the Britaines were ſo diuerſely mynded, and diſtracted in ſuche and ſo many parties, as ſcarſely any two Cities wolde ioyne together
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8941:68"/>
againſt a common perill: and thus, whiles one dyd ſtryue againſt an other, they went all to wrecke.</p>
            <p>Beſyde all this, the lyke diſſention fallynge amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g your Aunceſtours, the Britaines of the South and the Britaines of the Northe (nowe called Scottes) brought the kyngdome of the one ſide vnto the Englyſhe Saxones. For theſe beyng called in by the Southern Britaines to ayd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Scottiſh, turned their weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the Southern, &amp; ſpoyled them of theyre kyngdome. Thus by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the Britaines found theſe wordes to be true (whiche Vigetius ſayeth) <hi>ciuill hatred maketh menne raſhe to annoy their enemye, and heedleſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende them ſelues.</hi> But thoſe Engliſhe Saxones (when they had gotten the kyngdome) were by diſcorde and factions very ſone diuided: in ſo muche as of one kyngdome there dyd ſeuen aryſe, and ſo many kinges withall: by whoſe diſſentions the publike weale was a long while diſmembred, till at laſt after many yeres the Soueraigntie of all came to Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert alone. He was the firſt that called the Southe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte of Britaine by the name of England. Nowe then the Engliſhe Saxones recouered a force and waxed ſtronge. Vherevpon the Scottyſhe Britaines vnder the gouernement of king Achaius (doubting that the Saxones wold ſeke to tyrannize ouer them, as they had ouer the others) entered in to a firme &amp; perpetuall league of allyance &amp; amitie with Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the great, called Charlemain King of Fraunce: to the end that thoſe two nations, Frenſhe and Scottiſhe, ſhould from tyme to tyme for euer, ayde and ſuccour, one an other, againſt their common enemye. By occaſion of a lyke diſſention that fell among theſe Englyſhe Saxones, the Danes, vnder conduct of kyng Swayn, bereft the Saxones of the kyngdome of England. And at laſt the Normannes
<pb facs="tcp:8941:69"/>
vnder the leading of Duke VVilliam the Baſtard, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered the Realme of England. And ſince that tyme hitherto the whole Yland hath remained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gouernement only of two kynges. VVhoe neuertheleſſe, being ſo fewe, could not yet keepe peace and concorde amonge them ſelues.</p>
            <p>But yf a man will ſeke to know a reaſon whye Britaine can not brooke the regiment of many Soueraignes, as Germanie, Italie, and the famouſe ſtate of venice doe: he ſhall fynde (euen among them) <hi>that there is but one vvhiche is the heade.</hi> For thoughe the Princes of Germanie Lyue in great Libertie: yet are they neuertheleſſe all ſubiect to the authoritie of one Emperour: a thing very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for preſeruation of peace and concorde amonge them. And (for trueth) in Italie, there is no ſtayed forme of Gouernement, ſythe it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the rule and dominion, not of one, but of many: in reſpecte whereof ſome writers are of opinion that it is leſſe fortunate, if not miſerable. As for the ſtate of Venice, Conteranus hath in effect witten thus: For ſo muche (ſaythe he) as euery Citie by peace and vnion in mynde and conſent, is compact and buylt: and that this vniformitie in conſent and will can not be reteyned except ſome one perſone haue a preeminence ouer all other, aſwell magiſtrates as Commons: whiche may, as it were, of many ſeuerall diſperſed members, faſhion and frame one entyre bodye: It was therfore moſt wyſely prouided and ordeyned by our predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors that in our Citie there ſhould be a certaine Royall power, &amp; that one ſhould be choſen, which ſhould be called Prince or Soueraign. Hereupon I thynk it clear &amp; manifeſt, that the Soueraigntie of one onlie perſone is of all other moſt neceſſarye for a common wealthe. And this playnly maybe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8941:69"/>
not only in ciuil policie, but in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo. For by the prouidence of one God the whole worlde is ruled: ſo is the bodye of man by one ſoule gouerned: a ſhippe by one maſter is guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and one howſehold or familye is directed by one father: wherupon it foloweth, that your Yle of Britaine can not commodiouſlye be gouerned by manye Soueraignes. This affection therfore to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentiouſe parttaking is to be of all men eſchewed and abhorred, ſpecially of thoſe whiche are brought vp in the houſe of God. For it is theyr part &amp; dutye (all partialitie &amp; priuate quarrells ſett a ſyde) to moue and exhort others (as Sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin dyd) to all thinges that among chriſtians ſerue for the aboliſhing of ſtryfe, and eſtablyſhing of concord: whiche is nothing elſe but a quyetueſſe and peace of minde, faſtened and fortifyed with the bond of loue and Charitie: and ſuche a one as hateth all enmitie, and priuye grudge, and loueth all alyke. For Charitie (as Sainct Paul ſayeth) is patient,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> benigne: Charitie enuyeth not, dealeth not peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely, is not puffed vpp, is not ambitiouſe: thinketh not euell: reioyſeth not vpon iniquitie: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſeth with truthe: ſuffereth all thinges: beleueth all thinges: hopeth all thinges: beareth all thinges. Yf you embrace this ſentence: you will ſone lay aſyde all hatred: diſbourden your myndes of all diſdeyn and arrogance: and caſt away your madde armure, wherwith hitherto you haue vainly contended: and without all fraud and guyle you will eſtablyſhe a perpetuall, Chriſtian, profitable and aſſured peace, vnder the quiet and ſtedfaſt gouernement of one Prince. For ſo doeth bothe honeſtie and profitt admoniſhe vs to doe: all our own, aſwell priuate as publique affayre requyre and exact the ſame: and (whiche is more) allmightie God doeth ſo charge
<pb facs="tcp:8941:70"/>
and commaunde vs all to doe.</p>
            <p>Now then, who ſo euer repyneth againſt theſe thinges, is not to be called the childe of God: for he loueth not peace: neither ought good men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie any ſuche perſones, but rather to baniſhe them and all their Scholemaſters, as moſt cruell enemyes to the Citie of God. For their doctrine deſtroyeth the foundations of the ſocietie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde, &amp; aduaunceth Tyrannie. Among theſe men there is no regarde to the ſafetye of Citezens, nor loue to their natiue countrey: no care of religion, nor of true ſeruice &amp; obedience to God: but ſuche an in ordinate deſyre to rule and raigne they haue; as will vſurpe all things, take away the Lyues of honeſt Citizens: deſtroye their Countrie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne all Religion: As that fowle monſtrer <hi>Caeſar Borgias dyd,</hi> whome a certein <hi>Atheiſt</hi> greatly extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth as a moſt perfecte pattern for Princes to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. But for the auoyding of theſe enemyes to God and man, we haue a very wyſe admonition of the Chriſtian philoſophor Sainct Bernard. <hi>Fear not</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>that it is againſt Charitie, yf by offending one thou canneſt make peace for many.</hi> And Tullie gyueth a good leſſon for all true Princes to take hold of: <hi>That Loftineſſe of couraige</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vvhiche is tryed in perills, and hard aduentures, if it vvant Iuſtice, &amp; feighte not for the publick commoditie, but for priuate gayne, is not onlye no vertue, but rather a beaſtlie furye, raging againſt all humanitie. VVe vvill therfore</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt them only to be ſtout and valiant men: vvhiche are good men, freendes to trueth, not deceytfull but playne dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi> Of whiche opinion <hi>Edvvard king</hi> of England ſemed to be. For in his baniſhement he vſed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to ſaye, that he <hi>had rather allvvaies liue a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate lyfe, than to recouer his kingdome by the ſlaughter of men:</hi> A verie excellent ſayeing truellye and wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeming
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8941:70"/>
ſo noble a King. Let vs therfore roote out of our publick weall theſe diſturbers of common peace, that it maye more eaſily be conioyned and faſtned in an aſſured amitie and agreement. VVhich thing the better to obteyne, we muſt vſe the aduiſe and counſaile of a certein <hi>philoſophor.</hi> 
               <q>VVe affirme (ſayeth he) that, Cities are in peace and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, when in publique &amp; neceſſarie affaires they are all of one mynde, take all one aduiſe, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te that whiche by common conſent is allowed and agreed vpon: As for example, when it pleaſeth the Citizens to appoint certeine officers, or onlye Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus to haue the rule ouer all: but when bothe couet to enioye the Gouernement (as Oteocles &amp; Polynices did in Phaenicia) then ariſeth ſedition. For that ciuil concorde is in deed termed freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipe, whiche can not be reteyned but onely amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g honeſte men. Bycauſe ſuch as are honeſt are at peace within them ſelues and with others alſo, by reaſon that their willes abyde allwayes firme and ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, not ebbyng and flowenig lyke the ryuer Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus. It happeneth otherwiſe among the wicked: for they can not long agree together: bycauſe in their manner of gouerning the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthe, they ſeke all their own Priuate commoditie, and beſtow as litle paynes expenſes &amp; charges as they can: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon foloweth priuie grudges and ſeditions, whiles they endomage and hurt one an other: &amp; euery man neglecteth his owne dutie: and ſo the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtate periſheth when none goeth about to protecte it.</q>
Thus muche the Philoſopher. But touching the frendſhip whiche we ſpeake of, it is muche more eaſelye to be procured, compact, &amp; ratyfied among you, bycauſe all thoſe thinges concurre in you that are requiſitie and commodions to the vnion of mennes myndes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent in firme loue &amp; amitie.
<pb facs="tcp:8941:71"/>
For there is among you one ſtock and kynred, one allyance, and affinitie: one language: and almoſt one and the ſame courſe in manners, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, cuſtomes &amp; lawes: one and the ſame fauoure in countenance, lyke attyre, lyke behauiour in bodye, and lykeneſſe in perſonage. Yea all thinges elſe what ſoeuer, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the creation and preſeruation of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall peace and concorde, concurre and mete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among you, more fitlye than among other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whiche in olde tyme differed muche among them ſelfes aſwell in their natiue ſoile cuſtomes and lawes, as in their language, affinitie, and alliance, and yet at this daye neuertheleſſe are reconciled, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and vnited in a ciuil conſent and agrement, vnder the regiment of one Prince. Yet ſome of you perchaunce will thinke it vnpoſſible for that people long to continue in perfect amitie, whiche in ſo many yeres and aiges haue practized them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues one agaynſt an other, with fyre and ſwoord, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the worlde vpſide down in trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion by mutuall warres, ſpoyles, mallice, deadlie fede, morders, and all Kindes of hoſtilitie: ſithe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie mannes nature can not ſuffer ſo great iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be forgotten: &amp; ſithe the naturall conditions of bothe thoſe nations ſeeme to be ſuche, as either of them had rather ſuffer tenne thouſand deathes than to be ſubiecte to a Prince borne in the others prouince: bycauſe they woulde not ſeeme to be vnder ſubiection of their auncient enemye, after ſo long contention for the Soueraigntie: and ſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Engliſhe nation will by no meanes be ſubiect to a Scottiſhe Prince: nor yet the Scottiſhe nation to an Engliſhe. And it may be that ſome wicked Atheiſt, preferring his vaine glorie, ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and proud haughtie mynde before the good ſtate, and ſafetye of a publicke weaie, woulde ſubſcribe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8941:71"/>
perhapes, and Yeeld to this opinion: and yet is it a verye abſurde opinion and contrary to all witt and reaſon: euen as if one of your marriners in a great ſtormye tempeſt woulde ſaye that he had rather be drowned with the ſhyppe, than ſuffer it to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by any of his mates. But perhappes this felow will vrge further, and aſke how it can be that the Engliſhe &amp; Scottiſhe will agree together ſithe the Scottiſh haue euer preferred their league of alliance with the frenche nation before the neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoode and frendſhipp of the Englyſhe? For in deſpite of the Engliſhe they entred in a league of frendſhipp with the Frenche, ſeuen hundred yeres a goe and more, whiche they haue kept inuiolable to this daye. And in our dayes when there was great hope that the whole Yland wolde haue bene indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the regiment of one Prince by the mariage of kynge Edward the ſixt and the nowe Queene Marie of Scotland: The Scottes, though they had before aſſured her to King Edward by a common promiſſe, deliuered her ouer neuertheleſſe to the Kyng of Fraunce. Therfore it was their fault &amp; not the fault of the Engliſhe, that the amitie ſo muche expected betwene them was hymdred. But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that league which was made with the french, it was greatlye deſyred bothe by the frenche and by the Scottiſh (as I ſayd before) not in deſpite of the Engliſhe, but for theyr own ſafetye. For yf they had not doone ſo: the Scottes, aſwell as the other Britaines, had bene driuen out of their countrye, by that forrein and Barbarous nation, the Englyſh Saxons. And the lett of that Mariage proceded of the Englyſhe: whoſe vſe is to ſeek to wynne that of the Scottes by manacing wordes and force of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, whiche they ſhould deſyre by fayr meanes, &amp; termes of freendlye good will. And there wanteth
<pb facs="tcp:8941:72"/>
not occaſion to ſuſpecte that they dyd it of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to the end that by breakyng of that mariage, ſome of them might haue a more reddye acceſſe to the vſurpation of the Croune of England. How ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it was, the Scottyſh Nation was not mynded to yeeld by force, and yet ſcarſe able to forbeare, were conſtreyned to craue ayde of the Frenſhe: whiche they could not obteyne, onleſſe they ſent theyr Queene into Fraunce as an hoſtage for their fidelitie. But there was nothing that the Scottiſh nation more eſtemed and deſyred at that day, than the vnion of thoſe two regions by that mariage, as may well be proued by the common opinion and ſayeing of the people there, before the matter was attempted by way of force and armes: <hi>vve vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Engliſh mans language</hi> (ſayd the people) <hi>&amp; they oures: vve inhabit all one Yland: and almoſt in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doe vvee differre, but that vvee are gouerned by tvvo ſeuerall Princes.</hi> And in dede it is euidently knowne that the Scottiſhe Nation many yeres before dyd greatlye deſyre and wyſhe this manner of coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in amitye: and namely at ſuche tyme as they maried the noble Lady, Margaret, (the only heire of the croune of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, daughter of Alexander their King,) to the fyrſt Kyng Edward of England. By whiche maryage thoſe two kyngdomes had bene vnited, had not that noble virgin deceaſſed before ſhe came to the fyght of her huſband. Seing then the caſe thus ſtandeth: there is no cauſe whye ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Englyſh or Scottiſhe ſhould vpbraide or reproue one an other: but they ought rather to agree all together in one voyce and conſent, that (yf there were none alyue, to whome the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of the whole Yland by right could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed) one generall Prince ouer all might be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by voyce or lott: So as at laſt the whole weale
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8941:72"/>
publicque and people might enioye perpetuall peace, and be no more with partiall parttakinge, ſectes, &amp; factions, diſturbed: Euen as wee rede that the Perſians in olde tyme verie prouidently in a like caſe vſed them ſelues. For (as Iuſtine reporteth) when they had ſlayne their Mages: great was their glorie and renowme for the recouerye of their Kyngdome, but muche greater, for that in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng about the gouernement they coulde agree among them ſelues. There was among them many equall in vertue and nobilitie, as it was hard for the people to make an election of a gouernour. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theyr nobility deuiſed among them ſelues an indifferent mean whereby to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the iudgement of their woorthineſſe to their goddes. They agreed among them ſelues on a day appointed, to lead all theyr horſes before the Palace earlye in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng: and that he whoſe horſe fyrſt dyd neyghe before the riſing of the ſunne, ſhould be kyng. The next day after, when all were aſſembled at the houre appointed, the horſe of <hi>Darius</hi> ſonne of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſpes dyd firſt neygh, and gaue that happy ſigne of good fortune to his maiſter. Immediatlye the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtye of all the reſt was ſuche, as vpon the firſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earing of the good notice ſo gyuen they all leapt from their horſes, and dyd theyr homage to <hi>Darius</hi> as to their King: and all the commons foloweing the iugement of the nobles willyngly confirmed the election, &amp; accepted hym for theyr Soueraign. Thus the kyngdome of Perſians (wherof at one time there was ſeuen noble competitors) was in a moment reduced to the regiment of one. And this they dyd withe ſuche incredible zeale and pietie towardes theyr Countrye, as for the delyuerey therof from trouble and miſerye, they could haue bene content euery one to haue loſt his lyfe. Thus
<pb facs="tcp:8941:73"/>
farre Iuſtin.</p>
            <p>Immortall is the honour and renoume of thoſe noble men, whiche willinglie preferred the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their countrey before their priuate ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But allmightie God hathe eaſed you well of this doubt. For he hathe Layd it open before your eyes, what perſone it is, to whome the Soueraigntie of the whole Yland, euen by the lawes of the realm, after the deceaſe of the now Queene of England, without laufull iſſue of her body ought to deſcend and come: I mean the moſt noble Ladye Marye, the woorthie Quene of Scotland: whoſe appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pietie and vnuincible conſtancie in aduerſitie, vniuerſally well knowne and talked of through the whole, world doeth gyue a plain demonſtration, how vain and friuolous the Iudgment of thoſe men is, which repreſſe and reiect the Regiment of women. To this Ladye therfore may the regiment of the whole Yland at length deſcend, according as it was once before to her adiuged by the ſentence of her great graundfather Kyng Henry the ſeauenth, and of his Counſeill, as Polydor reporteth. Kyng Iames of Scotland the third (ſaieth he) dyd honorably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein Richard Fox Byſhop of duriſme, Ambaſſadour ſent to him by Kyng Henry the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th: and at their fyrſt meting, he ſhowed hym ſelfe muche greued for the late ſlaughter of his ſubiectes, but eaſilie he remitted the iniurie. Afterward when they were together alone, the Kyng tolde hym how auncient and iuſt cauſes of frendſhipp had bene betweene Kyng Henry and hym: and how greatly he deſired the aſſurance therof, that they two myght be tyed together in a more faſt knot of loue and amitie: whiche out of doubt will folow (ſayd the Kyng) yf King Henry wolde beſtow on hym his eldeſt daughter, the Ladye Margaret in Mariage. To this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8941:73"/>
the Amhaſſadour anſwered coldlie, but yet promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his helpe and furtherance: and put the Kyng in good hope of the matter if he wold ſend an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour directly to that end. The Ambaſſadour vpon hys returne home reported to Kyng Henry the whole matter, whiche pleaſed Kyng Henrye wonderous well, as one whiche delyted muche in peace. VVithin fewe dayes after this, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Kynge Iames came to requeſt the Ladye Margaret in Mariage. Kyng Henrye after audience referred the matter to his Counſeil: among whome, ſome there were whiche ſuppected that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might in proceſſe of tyme be deuolued to the ſame Ladye Margaret: and therfore thought it not good to marie her to a forain Prince: whereunto the Kyng made anſwere, and ſayd, what then? Yf any ſuche thing happen (whiche God forbid) yet I ſee, our kyngdome ſhould take no harme therby: for England ſhould not be added to Scotland, but Scotland vnto England: as to the farre moſt noble head of the whole Yland: for we ſee it ſo fallen owt in all thinges, that the leſſe is for honour ſake euer adioyned to that whiche is farre greater: as Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie in time paſt came to be vnder the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and power of the Kynges of England, our aunceſtors. The Kynges Iudgement was greatly commended: the whole Counſeil approued the matter with a full conſent: and the ſayd Ladye, and virgin, Margaret was maried to Kyng Iames. Thus farre hath Polidor. Thees are woordes of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, &amp; putte our matter clear out of doubt: for here it appeareth that the caſe ſolemnlie in counceil by a wyſe and prudent King, with wiſe, graue, and learned Counſeilours was debated and with great wiſedome reſolued &amp; concluded: and to this ſome lawyers of that land gyue great authoritie &amp; credit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8941:74"/>Thus it is euidently declared who are the true heires of the Crounes of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: and that the ſayd mariage of Iames the fowerth and the ſayd Lady Margaret is to be accompted a moſt fortunate benefit to the whole Yland. For if it be true (as in dede it is) that the mariage of the ſeuenth Kyng Henrie with the daughter and heir of King Edward the fowerth, was to be eſtemed as a moſt happie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to all England, becauſe it dyd cutt of and diſſolue all thoſe tumultes and ſeditions betwene the howſes of Yorke and Lancaſter which ſo many yeres had miſerablie afflicted all that nation: I pray you what reckening is to be made of the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie betwene King Iames the fowerth of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; the Ladye Margaret daughter to the King of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, ſithe nowe at laſt by the benefit of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, bothe England and Scotland may be quite reſkewed and deliuered from thoſe moſt mortall warres, and inteſtine diſſentions, whiche for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence ſake haue bene ſo long continewed and maintened? A happie prince therfore to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was King Henry the ſeuenth, for that by him allmightie God aboliſhed all ſeditions, and vnited the two howſes of yorke and Lancaſtre. But moſt fortunate &amp; moſt gratiouſe ſhall the renowmed Quene Mary of Scotland be, &amp; her moſt noble ſonne king Iames alſo, to the Engliſhe and Scottiſhe Nations: yf by them two the ſame God ſhall bringe the ſaid twoe ſeuerall kyngdomes to a perfect vnitie: reduce the whole Yle of Britaine to his moſte auncient eſtate of dignitie, and deliuer it from all ciuill warres and Barbarous crueltie.</p>
            <p>Embrace therfore (ye Britaines of all mortall men moſt fortunat) and take holde of this ſingular great benefit, when the ſame by the grace of the euerliuing God ſhalbe beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yow: and in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8941:74"/>
the mean time &amp; euer yeeld ye to him moſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble &amp; moſt hartie thankes, for that he of his infinite cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and benignitie hath at laſt produced out of booth you bloodes, a Prince, by whoſe helpe your domeſticall troubles and diſſentions may be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: &amp; a place left for this diuine lawe of peace and amitie to be planted, &amp; by the ſame law a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſafetye, and wellfare of all the people eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſhed.

               </gap> in peace and concord. But perpetuall peace and quyetneſſe can not be among you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe two Realmes be combined and made all one. For the force of vnitie is ſuche as the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof is the vtter moſte ende that nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth. Herehence alſo groweth among men cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, loue, &amp; frendſhipp, ſo farre, that many mindes are become all as one: firſt to remember that they muſt be truely menne in dede: and then that they leade a good &amp; bleſſed lyfe, whiche is the laſt ende and perfection of mankinde. Sithe therfore the matter goeth ſo: if you will folow God and the law of nature: if you deſire the ſafety and wellfare of your countrie: yf you will liue well and fortunat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in this world, and at laſt enioie the perfect bleſſe of eternall felicitie: you muſt enforce your ſelues with all labour, induſtrie and diligence, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed people may be called together, vnder the regiment of one rightfull Prince, and Catholique Religion of their aunceſtors. This will pleaſe all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and bring great tranquilitie, peace, &amp; quiet to your ſelues, and to all the people of England, Scotland, and Yreland. And that it maye ſo be, lett vs all continuallie pray to almightie God the ſupreme gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; ruler of the whole worlde.</p>
